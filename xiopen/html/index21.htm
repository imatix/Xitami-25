<H3><A NAME="TOC170">Release Notes for Xitami 2.5</A></H3>

<P>These are the release notes for the latest major version of
Xitami, since the last release of the previous major release.
Summary release notes for every release since 1.0a come afterwards.

<UL>
<LI>Further support for HTTP/1.1, including partial GETs. We now consider
Xitami to be a HTTP/1.1 server, although a number of optional HTTP/1.1
features are not yet implemented. The critical features implemented are:
keep-alive handling, document publishing, resume (partial GET), and
HTTP/1.1 virtual hosts.

<LI>SSI handling is now done internally. To use SSI pages you no longer
need to install Perl and the perlssi filter. The Xitami installation still
includes perlssi, but it is not activated in the .cfg file [Fiilters]
section. The new [SSI] section controls the internal SSI agent. The most
important config items in this section are:
<TABLE BORDER=0><TR>
<TD>enabled=1/0</TD><TD>Enable or disable SSI, enabled by default</TD>
<TD>timeout=30</TD><TD>Timeout for CGI programs called from the SSI agent</TD>
<TD>exec=0</TD>Enable/disable the #exec command, a potential security hole.
The SSI_INSECURE environment variable is no longer used.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
To re-enable use of the perlssi filter, remove references to xixssi in
xitami.cfg, and add the [Filter] definition for perlssi.

<LI>Xitami's logging capabilties have been given a complete overhaul. The
new logging agent lets you manage log file rotation/cycling in many
different ways, and lets you create log files in many formats.
<P>The built-in log file formats are:
<UL>
<LI>CLF  - Common-log format, as used by the NCSA httpd server.
<LI>CLFX - Extended CLF, as used by Apache and Xitami.
<LI>MS   - Microsoft format as used by IIS.
<LI>LML  - iMatix Logfile Markup Language, an XML format.
<LI>XLML - iMatix Extended LML, a richer XML format.
</UL>
<P>LML and XLML are intended to simplify log-file post-processing via an
XML-capable tool like GSLgen. You can also define custom log file formats
using any combination of text, delimiters, and logging data fields.
<P>The logging agent performs reverse-DNS translations on the fly, note
that you must define the RDNS configuration before this will work.
<P>You can cycle log files hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. You can cycle
the log files when the server starts-up, when they exceed some size in
kilobytes, or when they exceed some size in lines.
<P>You can specify the exact day and/or time a log file must be cycled.
<P>When cycling a log file, you can rename the old file, delete the old
file, move the old file to some directory, append the old data to some
file, or run an arbitrary command against the old log file.
<P>You can decide how to name old log files using a mask built from the
current day, time, and other information or text.
<P>Each virtual host can have independent settings for its HTTP and FTP log
files.

<LI>A new 'supervisor agent' cleans-out old log files, temporary files,
etc. This agent can be activated on servers that must run for long periods
without manual intervention or monitoring. By default it is disabled - set
the [Server] supervisor option to 1 to enable it.

<LI>Xitami can now act as a dynamic-DNS registration client, so that if you
register with a service like Xitami.Net, Xitami does the necessary work to
register your IP address. Xitami works with several DDNS services, and it's
quite easy to add other ones once you know the protocol used. This is an
example of the [Ddns] section, set-up to use the Xitami.net service (we've
blanked-out the password key):
<PRE>[Ddns]
    Domain = "black.xitami.net"
    Enabled = "1"
    Password = "TZO-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
    Service = "tzo.com"
    Username = "admin@xitami.com"
</PRE>

<LI>The LRWP protocol handler has been upgraded to LRWP/2.0, which is a
more secure and faster version of the LRWP protocol. Xitami still handles
LRWP/1.0 applications.

<LI>ISAPI support is now available, for Windows systems, as an LRWP plug-
in. You can download this from xitami.com.

<LI>Java Servlet support is available, for all systems, as a LRWP plug-in.
You can download this from xitami.com.

<LI>Various other improvements to the HTTP service:
<UL>
<LI>You can issue customised HTTP headers depending on file types.
<LI>Aliases can now refer to a full filename, which provides an easy way to
define a default file for a certain URL.
<LI>CGI programs can now be started under specific user ids and user
groups. This can be defined on a virtual-host basis.
<LI>If the URL parameter is 'sort=xxx', uses this value instead of the
current server:dirsort option.
</UL>

<LI>Various other improvements to the FTP service:
<UL>
<LI>Xitami supports the FTP user@hostname syntax for virtual hosts. This
lets you construct FTP logins to access virtual hosts, and some FTP clients
support this directly.
<LI>Uploads can no longer exceed hard quota.
</UL>

<LI>Xitami now uses GSLgen in several important places. GSL is iMatix's
Open Source template-based code-generation language. The GSLgen engine is
built-in to Xitami, and GSLgen is also provided as a seperate command-line
tool with Xitami. GSL templates are called 'scripts' and are normally
placed in the gsl subdirectory. You can modify these, but we recommend
you copy them and change the copies. Each virtual host can use its own set
of scripts.
<UL>
<LI>Each script starts with a small explanation, which you will need when
you want to change them or make your own. Especially useful is the list of
data fields that you can insert into the template.
<LI>HTTP directory listings are no longer hard-coded, but are now based on
a script called httpdir.gsl. The script creates a page with three columns,
each resortable. This uses the new '?sort=xxx' feature.
<LI>FTP messages, such as that shown when the user logs-in, are based on a
template, rather than the previous set of static text files. This lets you
show messages like 'there are X users logged-in to this server'.
<LI>You will also find GSLgen useful for analysing and processing log files
in LML or XLML formats.
<LI>Xitami lets you process XML files directly into HTML, using GSL scripts.
This is a powerful way of showing data that comes from other sources.
</UL>

<LI>The Xitami config file, xitami.cfg, now contains full documentation for
all options. The config file is actually generated using GSLgen, from an
XML definition file. The same XML definition file generates various pieces
of source code, and the HTML documentation for the config file options.
This is an example of a useful GSL application.

<LI>A new package, the Xitami SDK, contains a number of tools and
components that were previously either not supplied or were dispersed in
other packages:
<UL>
<LI>The iMatix Studio form compilers fdlgen and fmlgen. These tools are
used to create the HTML forms used in the Xitami WBA. FDL is a form
definition language based on htmlpp, and FML is an embedded form-markup
language based on HTML comment tags. Fdlgen converts an FDL file into FML,
and fmlgen converts an FML file into C language defintions that can be
compiled. A web program displays such forms using the form i/o system
(formio.c), also provided. FDL and FML are described in the fdldoc.txt and
fmldoc.txt files. Using these tools you can create your own derivates of
the Xitami WBA, and you can add the form functions to LRWP applications
written in C. The Xitami SDK includes the FDL file used by the Xitami WBA.
<LI>The WSX resource compiler, wsxrc. This is a Perl script that compiles
image files and other resources into C include files, so that they can be
compiled into an executable. The Xitami WBA uses this technique to compile
icons and images into the Xitami server executable, making the WBA faster
and more robust (not depending on external files). Wsxrc can easily be
adapted to generating other languages. One possible future for this tool is
to produce XML, which can then be fed to a GSL script. The Xitami SDK
includes the Xitami WBA resource file (xiadmin.rc) and all image files used
in the WBA (GIF files).
<LI>The Xitami configuration definition and script, xiconfig.xml and
xiconfig.gsl. These are the single source for all Xitami config option
definitions.
<LI>The Xitami model definitions and script, ximodel.xml and ximodel.gsl.
These generate the various Xitami models (xitami, xilite, xipro,...) from a
single script. You can define your own models, including the agents you
want. You will need to compile and link the generated program. We use a GSL
script here to avoid copying code.

<LI>Xitami 2.5 introduces the notion of <EM>throttle pipes</EM>, a
technique for limiting the bandwidth consumed by a web or FTP site. A
throttle pipe has a specific upload and download bandwidth, and is shared
by a set of web sites, and FTP sites. If throttle pipes are used (by
default they are disabled), then all HTTP accesses for a virtual host share
one throttle pipe.  FTP accesses use a default throttle pipe, but
individual logins can use other throttle pipes.  So, if you have a 64kbps
line, you can define all web and ftp downloads to share one 32kbps pipe,
while a privileged FTP login might have access to a 64kbps pipe.  Xitami
comes with a standard set of pipe definitions, but you can add more if you
want to.
