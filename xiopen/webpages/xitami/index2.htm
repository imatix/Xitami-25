<H2><A NAME="TOC1">Installing Xitami</A></H2>

<P>You can install Xitami in a few minutes on all platforms. For Windows,
Xitami comes with an installation Wizard. For OS/2 it is supplied as a
pre-built zip file. For UNIX and OpenVMS, Xitami is provided as a source kit
- you need an ANSI C compiler to rebuild it.

<A NAME="win32">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC5">GUI Version for Windows 95/98 or NT</A></H3>

<P>Download and run the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bw32.exe">32-bit Windows package</A>. The
installation Wizard will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
build a program group and icons to run Xitami. To run the installation
Wizard without the iMatix logo display, pass is "-nologo" on the command
line.

<P>You can uninstall Xitami by double-clicking the Uninstall icon. Under
Windows 95 and NT 4.x you can also select the 'Add/Remove Programs' option
in the control panel. Xitami maintains various items in the Windows
registry which the uninstall script should remove.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run it, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. You can use an alternative HTTP port such
as 5080. You then connect using the URL <TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>You can also download the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/swin.zip">source package</A> for Windows.
This compiles under MSVC 4.x or 5.x, and is necessary if you want to extend
the server using the WSX add-on protocol.  To build from the source package,
unzip it into a directory (e.g. c:\xitami\src) and double click on the
xitami.mdp file.  This launches MSVC.  Click on the 'Build' button, wait
until everything compiles, then click on 'Run'.  Note that this source
package contains the console (DOS box) version of Xitami.  The project
contains definitions for the GUI versions too, but these won't build unless
you've purchased the Windows GUI source code from us.

<P>If you use Windows 95, be aware that the earlier versions of this OS
can get into serious problems when heavily loaded with TCP/IP connections.
While Win95 is adequate for testing and for small sites, we cannot really
recommend it for serious sites - use NT or Linux.  If you find that your
Win95 system shows the classic 'Blue Screen of Death' when the server is
heavily loaded, consider installing the various patches and upgrades that
are supplied on the Microsoft site.

<HR>
<A NAME="win32_console">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC6">Console Version for Windows 95/98 and NT</A></H3>

<P>The console version of Xitami runs in a DOS box. Unlike the Windows GUI
version, it does not provide a control panel, so you stop the server using
Ctrl-C. The advantage of the console version is that messages are shown on
the screen directly, so it's a little easier to use when you're debugging a
difficult configuration. Otherwise, it's exactly the same Xitami. Download
and run the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bc32.exe">32-bit Windows console package</A>. The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and
will build a program group and icons to run Xitami.

<P>Some users of Windows 98 have reported that the console version of
Xitami runs more stably than the graphic version. This may be due to the
MSVC runtime, but in any case: if your GUI version of Xitami crashes after
heavy use under Win98, try using the console version.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run xidos32, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>To halt Xitami, press Ctrl-C. This shuts-down the server cleanly.

<P>You can uninstall Xitami by double-clicking the Uninstall icon. Under
Windows 95 and NT 4.x you can also select the 'Add/Remove Programs' option
in the control panel.

<H4><A NAME="TOC7">Using Xitami as a Service Under Windows 95</A></H4>
<P>You can also install the console version as a service under Windows
95/98.  This is a little-known ability of Win95/98, and it allows you to
automatically run Xitami when the computer boots, rather than when a user
logs in.  The Xitami console version installation package asks whether you
want to install it as a Win95 service.  If you choose this option, it
creates a small dispatcher, called "C:\Service.bat" which simply changes to
the Xitami directory and then runs Xitami.

<P>To start the dispatcher, the installation script adds an entry to the
registry, under "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices".
You can delete this entry at any time.  You can also edit service.bat to
remove the call to xidos32.exe.

<HR>
<A NAME="win32_service">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC8">Xitami Service for Windows NT</A></H3>

<P>Download and run the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bs32.exe">NT service package</A>.  The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
install Xitami as an NT service. You can start and stop the service using
the Service Control Manager or the Xitami control panel (in the Control
Panel window).

<P>We recommend that you log-on as administrator before you install Xitami.
If you install Xitami in a directory that contains a space, you will find
that the service does not start correctly.  You can fix this by editing the
registry (ugh!) to put quotes around the filename
<A href="index18.htm#start_service">as described in the faq</A> or by installing in Progra~1
instead of in 'Program Files'.

<P>The Xitami Service version accepts various command-line arguments when
run in a Dos window:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Argument:
<TH>Has this purpose:
<TR><TD>-i
<TD>Installs Xitami as a service.
<TR><TD>-u
<TD>Uninstalls the Xitami service.
<TR><TD>-d
<TD>Run Xitami as a console program.
<TR><TD>-d -h
<TD>Show help for command-line arguments.
</TABLE>

<P>You can pass any command-line arguments except -i, -u, and -d in the
'Startup Parameters' field in the Service Control Manager. When you run the
Xitami service as a command-line program, it acts identically to the vanilla
console version. You can use the service version on Windows 95, although the
-i and -u switches will not work.

<P>The Xitami service version has the same performance as the normal 32-bits
version, but will continue to work after you log off. Xitami runs on NT 3.51
and later versions.

<P>Under Windows NT 4.0 and later you can select the 'Add/Remove Programs'
option in the control panel to de-install Xitami. A bug in NT means that the
control panel itself (xiwinntc.cpl) will not be deleted. Xitami maintains
various items in the Windows registry, but these can be removed at any time
without affecting the server.

<H4><A NAME="TOC9">Manual Installation Of The Xitami NT Service</A></H4>

<P>On some (broken) NT systems that have problems running 16-bit code, the
self-installing .exe file may cause an error. In such a case you can install
the NT service by hand. Unzip the .exe install file (use WinZip or similar)
into a directory like C:\Program Files\Xitami.

<P>In a DOS box, in the Xitami directory, run 'xiwinnt -i' to install the
Xitami service. Then copy xiwinntc.cpl to the Windows NT system32 directory.
You can check that this works by using the NT service manager to stop/start
Xitami, and using the Xitami Control Panel.

<HR>
<A NAME="win16">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC10">Xitami for Windows 3.1 or 3.11</A></H3>

<P>To run Xitami on a Windows 3.x PC you must have a 386 or higher
processor. Xitami will run on a modest system; 4Mb RAM is enough if you do
not run any large applications.

<P>Download and run the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bw16.exe">16-bit Windows package</A>. The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
build a program group and icons to run Xitami. To uninstall Xitami,
double-click the Uninstall icon. Xitami does not create any files in the
Windows directories.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run it, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If another web
server is already using port 80, Xitami will not start. In that case, you
can choose a new port (e.g. 5080) and then connect using the URL
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>We have tested Xitami with some 16-bit Winsock libraries, but these are
notoriously unstable.  Our best recommendation are the Microsoft winsock
libraries, supplied with recent 16-bit versions Explorer. Windows 3.11 is
also reasonably robust.

<P>The limitations of 16-bit Windows mean that Xitami does not support CGI
programs under Windows 3.x. If someone tries to run a CGI program, Xitami
will show an error page.

<P>You can also run the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bc32.exe">32-bit console version</A> of
Xitami if you install Win32s.  This version has all the functionality of the
Windows 95 and NT versions (including FTP and browser-based admin) except
CGI.  This configuration lets you build web applications using the LRWP
protocol.

<HR>
<A NAME="os2">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC11">Xitami for OS/2</A></H3>

<P>The OS/2 version of Xitami was built using GCC 2.7.2.1 and runs with the
EMX 0.9c environment. The EMX DLLs will be required, and are available from
fine FTP sites everywhere (e.g. ftp.leo.org, ftp.cdrom.com,
hobbes.nmsu.edu). Compiled with assertions and gdb debugging information
disabled. The OS/2 version of Xitami was built by Ewen McNeill
<ewen@naos.co.nz> who also ported SFL and SMT to OS/2.

<P>The current distribution of Xitami for OS/2 was built for EMX 0.9c fix 2,
and will work with releases up to EMX 0.9c fix 4.

<P>Download the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/bos2.zip">OS/2 binary package</A> -- you'll need an
<A href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/">unzip</A> tool to extract the archive. You can also build the
server from the <A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/swin.zip">Windows source package</A>, using the supplied
xibuild.cmd file.

<P>To install an Desktop icon for Xitami, run install.cmd.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run xitami.exe, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>To halt Xitami, press Ctrl-C. This shuts-down the server cleanly.

<H4><A NAME="TOC12">Using TCP/IP With OS/2</A></H4>
<UL>
<LI>OS/2 Warp Connect and OS/2 Warp 4 (Merlin) are set-up for network-based
(LAN) TCP/IP automatically. In those cases it is just a matter of enabling
the loop-back connection, which can be done in the TCP/IP configuration
page, and then the address http://127.0.0.1/ can be used to access pages on
the same system. <LI>With OS/2 Warp 3 (i.e. not the connect version) only
serial-based TCP/IP is supplied but the loop-back connection can be enabled
using the <TT>ifconfig</TT> command:
<PRE>ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up
</PRE>
<LI>With OS/2 2.x there is no TCP/IP software supplied by default.
However, there is an extra package available from IBM (even today, we
think), which adds TCP/IP networking.  OS/2 1.x (16 bit code) doesn't
support TCP/IP at all as far as we know.
</UL>

<P>In all cases where TCP/IP is bundled with OS/2, it is an installation
option. Obviously the TCP/IP software must be installed to use TCP/IP-based
programs like Xitami.

<P>As far as we know, OS/2 can be used without a nameserver available (we
use a Linux machine as the nameserver for our network), if a 'hosts' file is
set up in the %ETC% directory (i.e. the directory pointed at by the ETC
environment variable. This directory is typically d:\tcpip\etc, or
d:\mptn\etc, where d: is the boot drive). The 'hosts' file should contain
the normal host information, i.e. the IP address, and then the name
associated with that IP address, on the same line separated by (one or more)
spaces. OS/2 can be told to use the hosts file before checking DNS by
setting the environment variable; set this line in config.sys and reboot:
<PRE>USE_HOSTS_FIRST=1
</PRE>

<A NAME="emx">&nbsp;</A>
<H4><A NAME="TOC13">Configuring The EMX System</A></H4>

<P>The default number of file handles for an EMX is around 20-40. This is
too little for a heavily-used server, and you may get errors logged as "out
of file handles".

<P>The number of file handles available in programs that use EMX can be
controlled via a runtime settable environment variable, EMXOPT.

<P>From the EMX runtime documentation (emxrt.doc):
<PRE>7 emx options
=============

You can customize emx by setting the EMXOPT environment variable. This
environment variable contains a list of options, similar to command line
options. The options must be separated by at least one blank.  Example:

    set emxopt=-c -h40

7.1 emx options (OS/2)
----------------------

-c      Disable core dumps caused by signals and exceptions

-h#     Set OS/2 file handle limit to #.  The number # must be between
        10 and 65536
[...]
</PRE>

<P>For a busy web server, a good value would be 120:
<PRE>set EMXOPT=-h120</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="TOC14">Source Installation For OS/2</A></H4>

<P>With the EMX development system (including the GNU C compiler) you can
rebuild Xitami on your OS/2 system. You must have installed EMX (we
recommend version 0.9c) including these packages: emxrt.zip, bsddev.zip,
gnudev1.zip, gnudev2.zip, emxdev1.zip, emxdev2.zip.

<P>To rebuild Xitami, first unzip the source package in a suitable
directory, e.g. C:\Xitami.  This creates a source tree and also installs the
various files and subdirectories that are needed for running Xitami.  The
sources are in src\sfl and src\smt.  You can build the executable using the
command file 'xibuild'.  If this fails, for some reason, you must build SFL
and SMT manually, but this is fairly simple:
<OL>
<LI>Open an OS/2 command window and cd to src\sfl, and type the command
'build'. If all goes well, this will compile the SFL library, and link a
number of test programs. The two files that you really need are libsfl.a (or
libsfl.lib, depending on how EMX is configured) and sfl.h.
<LI>Copy these two files into src\smt.  Now type 'build' in that directory
too.  This creates a number of files, but the two you really need are
xitami.exe and xixlat.exe.
<LI>Copy these two files into .... (the main Xitami directory).  You can
now type 'xitami' to start the web server.
</OL>

<HR>
<A NAME="unix">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC15">Source Installation For UNIX</A></H3>

<P>With an ANSI C compiler, you can rebuild Xitami on your system. Note that
the Xitami sources are ANSI C/POSIX compatible, and should build cleanly on
the majority of UNIX systems.  We and other people have tested Xitami on
these systems:
<UL>
<LI>Linux
<LI>IBM RS/6000 AIX
<LI>HP/UX
<LI>Digital UNIX (OSF/1)
<LI>SunOS and Solaris
<LI>SCO UNIXWare and OpenServer
<LI>SGI Irix
<LI>FreeBSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD
</UL>

<P>To install the source kit you need about 15Mb of disk space. You can
download the Xitami sources as a compressed tar file (.tgz). To unpack
a tgz file you need GNU gunzip.  Download the
<A href="http://users.skynet.be/sky95044/suni.tgz">suni.tgz</A> source kit.  To unpack the compressed file,
give these commands:
<PRE>gunzip suni.tgz
tar -xvf suni.tar
</PRE>

<P>The resulting directory structure includes the full sources for Xitami
(basically the <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl/">SFL</A> and <A href="http://www.imatix.com/html/smt/">SMT</A> packages), plus a build script,
<TT>xibuild</TT>, plus the directories and web pages you need to get started
with Xitami.

<P>The <TT>xibuild</TT> script compiles Xitami and installs the executable
program in the top directory (where <TT>xibuild</TT> is located). To run
<TT>xibuild</TT>, give these commands:

<PRE>chmod +x xibuild
./xibuild</PRE>

<P>When you have built Xitami, run xitami, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>If Xitami does not build cleanly on your system, the problem will usually
lie in non-standard code in the SFL library upon which Xitami is based. It's
possible that your system (or compiler) does not do what SFL expects. In
general the only file which you may need to change is the prelude.h file in
the SFL directory. Read the SFL doc if you think you want to make changes to
this library (it's pretty simple, really, and many people done this).

<HR>
<A NAME="vms">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC16">Source Installation For OpenVMS</A></H3>

<P>With UCX and Vax C or Dec C, you can rebuild Xitami on your OpenVMS
system. OpenVMS 6.1 or prior may not work correctly.  Note that the Xitami
sources are ANSI C/POSIX compatible, and depend on support from the OpenVMS
system libraries to some extent. These were not fully POSIX in OpenVMS prior
to 7.0, through Xitami (actually, SFL, which provides the portability layer)
gets around the most blatant differences.

<P>The section on building Xitami must still be completed.  However, the
process is fairly simple:
<UL>
<LI>Install the UNIX source kit.
<LI>Build the SFL library by compiling all the files sfl*.c in the src/sfl
directory.  Create a library libsfl.olb containing the resulting objects.
You should find that the command @build.txt does this.
<LI>Build the SMT library by compiling all the files smt*.c (except
smtschm.c) and all the files xi*.c.  Create a library libsmt.old containing
the resulting objects.
<LI>Link xitami.obj with these two libraries to give xitami.exe and copy
this to the root install directory.
<LI>Define an external command:
<PRE>$ xitami :== $disk_whatever:[root.install.dir]xitami.exe
</PRE>
<LI>Run xitami with arguments '-b 5000' to start it on port 5080.
</UL>

<P>Xitami runs fully, except for a couple of restrictions. The directory
list functions do not (yet) work. To run a CGI program you must define an
external command before starting the server. This is necessary so that
Xitami can pass arguments to the program. For example:
<PRE>$ testcgi :== $DKA300:[.cgi-bin]testcgi.exe
$ xitami -b 5000
</PRE>
