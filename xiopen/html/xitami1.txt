.page Welcome To Xitami

.H1 $(TITLE)

<P>Welcome to the Xitami online documentation.  These pages describe how to
install, use, and configure Xitami for your needs.  You can go directly to
the $(*toc=Table of Contents).  You'll also find a large
$(*faqlink=FAQ_section) that provides answers to many frequently-asked
questions.  Please read this FAQ before asking for technical support.  The
$(*group=Xitami discussion group) is an active forum and an excellent place
to ask questions and discuss issues surrounding Xitami.

<P>To download Xitami go to the $(*download=Download_Corner).

<P>If you use Xitami, please register now for information about bug fixes
and updates.  It's free - just <A HREF="mailto:register-xitami@imatix.com">
send us an e-mail</A> with subject 'register' and your comments, if any.

<P>Xitami is a high-quality portable free web server. It is distributed with
source code according to a liberal $(*license=License_Agreement). Please
take a minute to read this.

<P>What's special about Xitami?
<UL>
<LI>It runs on all UNIX platforms, OS/2, OpenVMS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95,
and Windows NT.  At iMatix, we make software portability a reality.
<LI>You'll be surprised at how easily Xitami installs.  Since the software
comes fully configured, you don't need to change a single option to run it.
<LI>Xitami is small, fast, and robust: it's based on a solid software
engineering tools that we developed for multithreaded TCP/IP servers.
<LI>Unlike any other web server, Xitami was designed as a set of portable
reusable components.  It's easy to extend and reincorporate.
</UL>

<P>If you're a software developer, visit the $(*imatix=iMatix_home_page) and
take a look at our other products. $(*libero=Libero), $(*sfl=SFL), and
$(*smt=SMT) are the unique software tools that make Xitami fast and
portable. You can use them freely in any project; if you intend to extend
Xitami, you'll want these tools.

<P>You can install Xitami in a few minutes on all platforms. For Windows,
Xitami comes with an installation Wizard. For OS/2 it is supplied as a
pre-built zip file. For UNIX and OpenVMS, Xitami is provided as a source kit
- you need an ANSI C compiler to rebuild it.

<HR>
.build anchor win32
<H3>GUI Version for Windows 95/98 or NT</H3>

<P>Download and run the $(*kit_win32=32-bit_Windows_package). The
installation Wizard will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
build a program group and icons to run Xitami. To run the installation
Wizard without the iMatix logo display, pass is "-nologo" on the command
line.

<P>You can uninstall Xitami by double-clicking the Uninstall icon. Under
Windows 95 and NT 4.x you can also select the 'Add/Remove Programs' option
in the control panel. Xitami maintains various items in the Windows
registry which the uninstall script should remove.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run it, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. You can use an alternative HTTP port such
as 5080. You then connect using the URL <TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>You can also download the $(*kit_win32_src=source_package) for Windows.
This compiles under MSVC 4.x or 5.x, and is necessary if you want to extend
the server using the WSX add-on protocol.  To build from the source package,
unzip it into a directory (e.g. c:\xitami\src) and double click on the
xitami.mdp file.  This launches MSVC.  Click on the 'Build' button, wait
until everything compiles, then click on 'Run'.  Note that this source
package contains the console (DOS box) version of Xitami.  The project
contains definitions for the GUI versions too, but these won't build unless
you've purchased the Windows GUI source code from us.

<P>If you use Windows 95, be aware that the earlier versions of this OS
can get into serious problems when heavily loaded with TCP/IP connections.
While Win95 is adequate for testing and for small sites, we cannot really
recommend it for serious sites - use NT or Linux.  If you find that your
Win95 system shows the classic 'Blue Screen of Death' when the server is
heavily loaded, consider installing the various patches and upgrades that
are supplied on the Microsoft site.

<HR>
.build anchor win32_console
<H3>Console Version for Windows 95/98 and NT</H3>

<P>The console version of Xitami runs in a DOS box. Unlike the Windows GUI
version, it does not provide a control panel, so you stop the server using
Ctrl-C. The advantage of the console version is that messages are shown on
the screen directly, so it's a little easier to use when you're debugging a
difficult configuration. Otherwise, it's exactly the same Xitami. Download
and run the $(*kit_win32_console=32-bit_Windows_console_package). The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and
will build a program group and icons to run Xitami.

<P>Some users of Windows 98 have reported that the console version of
Xitami runs more stably than the graphic version. This may be due to the
MSVC runtime, but in any case: if your GUI version of Xitami crashes after
heavy use under Win98, try using the console version.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run xidos32, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>To halt Xitami, press Ctrl-C. This shuts-down the server cleanly.

<P>You can uninstall Xitami by double-clicking the Uninstall icon. Under
Windows 95 and NT 4.x you can also select the 'Add/Remove Programs' option
in the control panel.

<H4>Using Xitami as a Service Under Windows 95</H4>
<P>You can also install the console version as a service under Windows
95/98.  This is a little-known ability of Win95/98, and it allows you to
automatically run Xitami when the computer boots, rather than when a user
logs in.  The Xitami console version installation package asks whether you
want to install it as a Win95 service.  If you choose this option, it
creates a small dispatcher, called "C:\Service.bat" which simply changes to
the Xitami directory and then runs Xitami.

<P>To start the dispatcher, the installation script adds an entry to the
registry, under "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices".
You can delete this entry at any time.  You can also edit service.bat to
remove the call to xidos32.exe.

<HR>
.build anchor win32_service
<H3>Xitami Service for Windows NT</H3>

<P>Download and run the $(*kit_win32_service=NT_service_package).  The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
install Xitami as an NT service. You can start and stop the service using
the Service Control Manager or the Xitami control panel (in the Control
Panel window).

<P>We recommend that you log-on as administrator before you install Xitami.
If you install Xitami in a directory that contains a space, you will find
that the service does not start correctly.  You can fix this by editing the
registry (ugh!) to put quotes around the filename
$(*start_service=as described in the faq) or by installing in Progra~1
instead of in 'Program Files'.

<P>The Xitami Service version accepts various command-line arguments when
run in a Dos window:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Argument:
<TH>Has this purpose:
<TR><TD>-i
<TD>Installs Xitami as a service.
<TR><TD>-u
<TD>Uninstalls the Xitami service.
<TR><TD>-d
<TD>Run Xitami as a console program.
<TR><TD>-d -h
<TD>Show help for command-line arguments.
</TABLE>

<P>You can pass any command-line arguments except -i, -u, and -d in the
'Startup Parameters' field in the Service Control Manager. When you run the
Xitami service as a command-line program, it acts identically to the vanilla
console version. You can use the service version on Windows 95, although the
-i and -u switches will not work.

<P>The Xitami service version has the same performance as the normal 32-bits
version, but will continue to work after you log off. Xitami runs on NT 3.51
and later versions.

<P>Under Windows NT 4.0 and later you can select the 'Add/Remove Programs'
option in the control panel to de-install Xitami. A bug in NT means that the
control panel itself (xiwinntc.cpl) will not be deleted. Xitami maintains
various items in the Windows registry, but these can be removed at any time
without affecting the server.

<H4>Manual Installation Of The Xitami NT Service</H4>

<P>On some (broken) NT systems that have problems running 16-bit code, the
self-installing .exe file may cause an error. In such a case you can install
the NT service by hand. Unzip the .exe install file (use WinZip or similar)
into a directory like C:\Program Files\Xitami.

<P>In a DOS box, in the Xitami directory, run 'xiwinnt -i' to install the
Xitami service. Then copy xiwinntc.cpl to the Windows NT system32 directory.
You can check that this works by using the NT service manager to stop/start
Xitami, and using the Xitami Control Panel.

<HR>
.build anchor win16
<H3>Xitami for Windows 3.1 or 3.11</H3>

<P>To run Xitami on a Windows 3.x PC you must have a 386 or higher
processor. Xitami will run on a modest system; 4Mb RAM is enough if you do
not run any large applications.

<P>Download and run the $(*kit_win16=16-bit_Windows_package). The
installation program will prompt you for an installation directory, and will
build a program group and icons to run Xitami. To uninstall Xitami,
double-click the Uninstall icon. Xitami does not create any files in the
Windows directories.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run it, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If another web
server is already using port 80, Xitami will not start. In that case, you
can choose a new port (e.g. 5080) and then connect using the URL
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>We have tested Xitami with some 16-bit Winsock libraries, but these are
notoriously unstable.  Our best recommendation are the Microsoft winsock
libraries, supplied with recent 16-bit versions Explorer. Windows 3.11 is
also reasonably robust.

<P>The limitations of 16-bit Windows mean that Xitami does not support CGI
programs under Windows 3.x. If someone tries to run a CGI program, Xitami
will show an error page.

<P>You can also run the $(*kit_win32_console=32-bit_console_version) of
Xitami if you install Win32s.  This version has all the functionality of the
Windows 95 and NT versions (including FTP and browser-based admin) except
CGI.  This configuration lets you build web applications using the LRWP
protocol.

<HR>
.build anchor os2
.pipe os2-readme.htm=Xitami installation for OS/2
<H3>Xitami for OS/2</H3>

<P>The OS/2 version of Xitami was built using GCC 2.7.2.1 and runs with the
EMX 0.9c environment. The EMX DLLs will be required, and are available from
fine FTP sites everywhere (e.g. ftp.leo.org, ftp.cdrom.com,
hobbes.nmsu.edu). Compiled with assertions and gdb debugging information
disabled. The OS/2 version of Xitami was built by Ewen McNeill
<ewen@naos.co.nz> who also ported SFL and SMT to OS/2.

<P>The current distribution of Xitami for OS/2 was built for EMX 0.9c fix 2,
and will work with releases up to EMX 0.9c fix 4.

<P>Download the $(*kit_os2=OS/2_binary_package) -- you'll need an
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool to extract the archive. You can also build the
server from the $(*kit_win32_src=Windows source package), using the supplied
xibuild.cmd file.

<P>To install an Desktop icon for Xitami, run install.cmd.

<P>When you have installed Xitami, run xitami.exe, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>To halt Xitami, press Ctrl-C. This shuts-down the server cleanly.

<H4>Using TCP/IP With OS/2</H4>
<UL>
<LI>OS/2 Warp Connect and OS/2 Warp 4 (Merlin) are set-up for network-based
(LAN) TCP/IP automatically. In those cases it is just a matter of enabling
the loop-back connection, which can be done in the TCP/IP configuration
page, and then the address http://127.0.0.1/ can be used to access pages on
the same system. <LI>With OS/2 Warp 3 (i.e. not the connect version) only
serial-based TCP/IP is supplied but the loop-back connection can be enabled
using the <TT>ifconfig</TT> command:
<PRE>ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up
</PRE>
<LI>With OS/2 2.x there is no TCP/IP software supplied by default.
However, there is an extra package available from IBM (even today, we
think), which adds TCP/IP networking.  OS/2 1.x (16 bit code) doesn't
support TCP/IP at all as far as we know.
</UL>

<P>In all cases where TCP/IP is bundled with OS/2, it is an installation
option. Obviously the TCP/IP software must be installed to use TCP/IP-based
programs like Xitami.

<P>As far as we know, OS/2 can be used without a nameserver available (we
use a Linux machine as the nameserver for our network), if a 'hosts' file is
set up in the %ETC% directory (i.e. the directory pointed at by the ETC
environment variable. This directory is typically d:\tcpip\etc, or
d:\mptn\etc, where d: is the boot drive). The 'hosts' file should contain
the normal host information, i.e. the IP address, and then the name
associated with that IP address, on the same line separated by (one or more)
spaces. OS/2 can be told to use the hosts file before checking DNS by
setting the environment variable; set this line in config.sys and reboot:
<PRE>USE_HOSTS_FIRST=1
</PRE>

.build anchor emx
<H4>Configuring The EMX System</H4>

<P>The default number of file handles for an EMX is around 20-40. This is
too little for a heavily-used server, and you may get errors logged as "out
of file handles".

<P>The number of file handles available in programs that use EMX can be
controlled via a runtime settable environment variable, EMXOPT.

<P>From the EMX runtime documentation (emxrt.doc):
<PRE>7 emx options
=============

You can customize emx by setting the EMXOPT environment variable. This
environment variable contains a list of options, similar to command line
options. The options must be separated by at least one blank.  Example:

    set emxopt=-c -h40

7.1 emx options (OS/2)
----------------------

-c      Disable core dumps caused by signals and exceptions

-h#     Set OS/2 file handle limit to #.  The number # must be between
        10 and 65536
[...]
</PRE>

<P>For a busy web server, a good value would be 120:
<PRE>set EMXOPT=-h120</PRE>

<H4>Source Installation For OS/2</H4>

<P>With the EMX development system (including the GNU C compiler) you can
rebuild Xitami on your OS/2 system. You must have installed EMX (we
recommend version 0.9c) including these packages: emxrt.zip, bsddev.zip,
gnudev1.zip, gnudev2.zip, emxdev1.zip, emxdev2.zip.

<P>To rebuild Xitami, first unzip the source package in a suitable
directory, e.g. C:\Xitami.  This creates a source tree and also installs the
various files and subdirectories that are needed for running Xitami.  The
sources are in src\sfl and src\smt.  You can build the executable using the
command file 'xibuild'.  If this fails, for some reason, you must build SFL
and SMT manually, but this is fairly simple:
<OL>
<LI>Open an OS/2 command window and cd to src\sfl, and type the command
'build'. If all goes well, this will compile the SFL library, and link a
number of test programs. The two files that you really need are libsfl.a (or
libsfl.lib, depending on how EMX is configured) and sfl.h.
<LI>Copy these two files into src\smt.  Now type 'build' in that directory
too.  This creates a number of files, but the two you really need are
xitami.exe and xixlat.exe.
<LI>Copy these two files into ..\.. (the main Xitami directory).  You can
now type 'xitami' to start the web server.
</OL>
.endpipe

<HR>
.build anchor unix
.pipe unix-readme.htm=Xitami installation for UNIX
<H3>Source Installation For UNIX</H3>

<P>With an ANSI C compiler, you can rebuild Xitami on your system. Note that
the Xitami sources are ANSI C/POSIX compatible, and should build cleanly on
the majority of UNIX systems.  We and other people have tested Xitami on
these systems:
<UL>
<LI>Linux
<LI>IBM RS/6000 AIX
<LI>HP/UX
<LI>Digital UNIX (OSF/1)
<LI>SunOS and Solaris
<LI>SCO UNIXWare and OpenServer
<LI>SGI Irix
<LI>FreeBSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD
</UL>

<P>To install the source kit you need about 15Mb of disk space. You can
download the Xitami sources as a compressed tar file (.tgz). To unpack
a tgz file you need GNU gunzip.  Download the
$(*kit_unix=suni%(vxi).tgz) source kit.  To unpack the compressed file,
give these commands:
<PRE>gunzip suni%(vxi).tgz
tar -xvf suni%(vxi).tar
</PRE>

<P>The resulting directory structure includes the full sources for Xitami
(basically the $(*sfl=SFL) and $(*smt=SMT) packages), plus a build script,
<TT>xibuild</TT>, plus the directories and web pages you need to get started
with Xitami.

<P>The <TT>xibuild</TT> script compiles Xitami and installs the executable
program in the top directory (where <TT>xibuild</TT> is located). To run
<TT>xibuild</TT>, give these commands:

<PRE>chmod +x xibuild
\./xibuild</PRE>

<P>When you have built Xitami, run xitami, then connect with any web
browser. You should see the "Welcome To Xitami" test page. If Xitami cannot
run on its normal port (80), it shows an error message: this can happen if
another server is using port 80. To use an alternative HTTP port, use the
'-b' option. This shifts the standard HTTP and FTP ports by some 'base'. For
example, '-b 5000' runs the Xitami HTTP service on port 5080 and the FTP
service on port 5021. You would then connect using
<TT>http://localhost:5080/</TT>.

<P>If Xitami does not build cleanly on your system, the problem will usually
lie in non-standard code in the SFL library upon which Xitami is based. It's
possible that your system (or compiler) does not do what SFL expects. In
general the only file which you may need to change is the prelude.h file in
the SFL directory. Read the SFL doc if you think you want to make changes to
this library (it's pretty simple, really, and many people done this).
.endpipe

<HR>
.build anchor vms
<H3>Source Installation For OpenVMS</H3>

<P>With UCX and Vax C or Dec C, you can rebuild Xitami on your OpenVMS
system. OpenVMS 6.1 or prior may not work correctly.  Note that the Xitami
sources are ANSI C/POSIX compatible, and depend on support from the OpenVMS
system libraries to some extent. These were not fully POSIX in OpenVMS prior
to 7.0, through Xitami (actually, SFL, which provides the portability layer)
gets around the most blatant differences.

<P>The section on building Xitami must still be completed.  However, the
process is fairly simple:
<UL>
<LI>Install the UNIX source kit.
<LI>Build the SFL library by compiling all the files sfl*.c in the src/sfl
directory.  Create a library libsfl.olb containing the resulting objects.
You should find that the command @build.txt does this.
<LI>Build the SMT library by compiling all the files smt*.c (except
smtschm.c) and all the files xi*.c.  Create a library libsmt.old containing
the resulting objects.
<LI>Link xitami.obj with these two libraries to give xitami.exe and copy
this to the root install directory.
<LI>Define an external command:
<PRE>$ xitami :== $disk_whatever:[root.install.dir]xitami.exe
</PRE>
<LI>Run xitami with arguments '-b 5000' to start it on port 5080.
</UL>

<P>Xitami runs fully, except for a couple of restrictions. The directory
list functions do not (yet) work. To run a CGI program you must define an
external command before starting the server. This is necessary so that
Xitami can pass arguments to the program. For example:
<PRE>$ testcgi :== $DKA300:[.cgi-bin]testcgi.exe
$ xitami -b 5000
</PRE>

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Xitami Under Windows</H3>

<P>The Windows version of Xitami provides a simple control panel that lets
you start, stop, and monitor the web server. The service version is easily
installed as an NT service, or can be run as a command-line program. It then
accepts the command-line switches described later.

<H3>Xitami Under UNIX</H3>

<P>Under UNIX, Xitami can run as a foreground process or a daemon. You can
run it interactively to test your configuration, and then configure your
system <TT>inittab</TT> or start-up scripts to run it automatically.

.build anchor syntax
<P>This is the command-line syntax for Xitami:

<PRE>Syntax: xitami [options...]
Options:
  -r directory     Root directory for web pages (webpages).
  -c directory     Directory for CGI programs (cgi-bin).
  -b portbase      Shift HTTP port 80 by this value.  E.g. to run
                   Xitami on port 7080, do 'xitami -b 7000'.
  -l filename      Log file for output (xitami.log).
  -a filename      Authentication file (xitami.aut).
  -q               Quite mode: no messages or log.
  -s               Server mode: run as background job.
  -t               Trace all socket i/o operations to log file.
  -v               Show Xitami version information.
  -h               Show summary of command-line options.
</PRE>

<P>The -s option has no effect on Windows systems; under UNIX it
does the following: Xitami recreates itself as a background
process, ignoring the SIGHUP signal.

<H3>Testing Xitami</H3>

<P>Run Xitami as described in the installation section. Connect with a
browser to the URL: <TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>/</TT> or
<TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>:5080/</TT>. If Xitami is correctly installed,
you should see a page entitled: "Welcome To Xitami". Please read this page
and try the various links and buttons to ensure that Xitami is working
correctly. If you install your own web pages, you can still access the
Xitami Welcome page by using the URL:
<TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>/default.htm</TT>.

<H3>Using Xitami</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Xitami assumes that all web pages are in a subdirectory called
'webpages'.
<LI>CGI scripts and programs are in a subdirectory called
'cgi-bin'.
<LI>Directories can be protected by editing the file 'xitami.aut'.
<LI>Logging information is stored in two files: 'xitami.log' logs
information and error messages; 'access.log' logs HTTP requests.
</UL>
<P>These options can be changed. The webpages directory can be any relative
(depending on the directory where Xitami is run) or absolute directory (with
a full path name).

<P>The cgi-bin directory can be specified in various ways - see the section
on $(*cgidir=CGI_programming) in Xitami.

<P>Xitami will negotiate with the web browser to find a file when the URL
does not specify a filename. It will search for an HTML file called
index.htm, index.html, default.htm, or default.html, in that order. If none
of these files are found, Xitami returns the directory listing, formatted as
an HTML page.  Note that Xitami automatically looks for files with an
extension .html if a file with the .htm extension could not be found, and
vice-versa.

<P>You should install a file called 'index.htm' in the webpages directory,
to override the 'default.htm' file used by Xitami.

<H3>User Authentication</H3>

<P>Xitami supports the HTTP/1.0 Basic Authentication protocol. This is a
minimalistic security approach that is quick and supported by all browsers,
but which should not be used for very sensitive data, since the user name
and password can be extracted from the TCP/IP packets sent by the browser.

<P>The xitami.aut file holds the authentication information. This file is
not encoded, but is not accessible by browsers unless you place it in the
webpages directory. You can modify this file on the fly; Xitami will reload
it after a short delay (the server:refresh option).

<P>Protection is applied to directories or individual URLs. This is what
an authentication file looks like:

<PRE>#  Authorization file for XITAMI
#  Each [Entry] defines a protected URL or directory.
#  The directory name is followed by user=password pairs
#
[/Admin]
    admin=top secret
    realm=On-Line Administration
[stats/index.htm]
    root=PakYupTon
    admin=QzeCat96
    webmask=local
[/private]
    jacky="funny;password"
    sarah=arabica
    jonas=realtime
</PRE>

<P>Each section name specifies an URI or a directory name; the leading slash
is optional. When checking a resource called "/pub/mypages/file", Xitami will
look for entries in this order:
<PRE>[/pub/mypages/file]
[pub/mypages/file]
[/pub/mypages]
[pub/mypages]
[/pub]
[pub]
[/]
</PRE>

<P>The directory or URL name is not case-sensitive; Xitami always treats it
as lower-case. On systems where filenames are case-sensitive, "PRIVATE" and
"private" are treated as equal by Xitami, and are both handled by the
authentication data for [Private]. The user name is also case-insensitive.
The password is case-insensitive if the option security:password-case is set
to 0.

<P>Passwords can contain any printable character except ' and ". If you edit
or create the password file by hand or using scripts, use double quotes
around passwords to make sure that special characters like ; and # (which
indicate comments) are treated as part of the password.

<P>The entry 'webmask=' is treated in a special manner; this defines the
set of valid IP addresses for clients trying to access the directory.
The section on $(*webmasks) provides more details.  If you define an entry
consisting only of 'webmask=', Xitami will treat this as a resource that is
protected (has an entry) but has no valid users.

<P>The entry 'realm=' is also treated in a special manner; this defines the
'Realm' for the authentication.  The realm is returned to the browser, and
is the basis upon which it will remember user names and passwords.  If you
use the same realm for several directories or URLs, make sure that the user
names and passwords also match.  If no realm is defined, Xitami returns the
[Entry] name as the realm.

<P>The entry 'http-update=' is used to determine whether the HTTP PUT, COPY,
MOVE, and DELETE methods are allowed for the URL. By default these are not
permitted. To allow them, add 'http-update=1' to the authorisation file.

<P>A password "-" is treated as meaning 'not allowed' for that user. If
there is only one user defined, the resource will be inaccessible. This is
used, for example, in the default xitami.aut file to indicate that the
administration URL '/admin' is not accessibly until a non-default password
has been entered.  An empty password is treated as meaning 'non required'
for that user.

<P>The entry 'all=*' allows access to all users without a user id/password
check.  You can combine this with the webmask option to restrict access by
webmask without requiring user id/password entry at the same time.

<P>When using Xitami/Pro's SSL connection, you can allow access to a
protected resource to users who have a valid certificate.  Certified users
will bypass the 'user/password' prompt, and access the protected resource
directly.  For this to work, you must define the password for each such user
as '*SSL'.  This is taken to mean: allow this user access if they have a
valid certificate.

<H3>Xitami Log Files</H3>

<H4>The Xitami Server Log File</H4>

<P>Xitami logs errors and information to the file 'xitami.log'. This file is
always opened in append mode. It looks something like this:
<PRE>96/12/05 20:19:41: I: OPEN port=80
96/12/06 07:22:03: I: OPEN port=80
</PRE>
To configure the server log, see the $(*config_serverlog=[Serverlog])
configuration entry.

<P>By default, Xitami logs all HTTP requests to the file 'access.log', which
follows the common CERN/NCSA standard for web server log files. The log file
format consists of lines in this format:
<PRE>host - user [DD/Mon/YYYY:hh:mm:ss] "request" ddd bbbb "referer" "agent"
</PRE>
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR NOWRAP><TH>This field:<TH>Has this purpose:
<TR NOWRAP><TD>host       <TD>IP number of requesting host
<TR NOWRAP><TD>user       <TD>Userid sent for authentication, or -
<TR NOWRAP><TD>request    <TD>HTTP request sent by client
<TR NOWRAP><TD>ddd        <TD>Status code returned by server
<TR NOWRAP><TD>bbbb       <TD>Size of data sent, excluding HTTP header
<TR NOWRAP><TD>referer    <TD>Referer document, or ""
<TR NOWRAP><TD>agent      <TD>User agent (browser), or ""
</TABLE>

<P>The access log files are automatically cycled: when Xitami starts, it
will save any existing file before starting a new access log. The old access
log file is given a name based on the date when it was last modified.

<H4>Extended Logging</H4>

<P>Xitami has an extended logging function that is much richer than the
standard access logging function. The extended logging function gives you
more control over the way that log files are cycled, over the log file
names, and over the log file format. The extended logging function also does
reverse-DNS translation of IP addresses.

The extended logging function works with access logs and error logs, and is
controlled by a number of additional configuration options in the
[ServerLog], [AccessLog], [ErrorLog], [FTPLog], and [FTPErrLog] sections:

.macro item <DT><TT><B>$*</B></TT>

<DL>
.item format
<DD>Specifies the log file format.  You can use one of a number of
predefined formats, or build your own format using any of these symbols:

<DD>Default: CLFX (compatible with standard Xitami).
<P>Note that the XML-based format are easy to work with using iMatix's GSLgen
tool.  GSLgen lets you create arbitrary reports, statistics, and HTML analyses
of access log data.

.item cycle
<DD>Specifies when to cycle the log file.  Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only
<LI>size, or 6 - cycle the log file when it exceeds some size in Kbytes
<LI>lines, or 7 - cycle the log file when it exceeds some size in lines
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

.item cycle-how
<DD>Specifies how to cycle the log file.  Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>rename - rename the old log file, and create a new file.
<LI>delete - delete the old log file, and create a new file.
<LI>move - move the old log file to some directory, and create a new file.
<LI>concat - append the old log file to some file, and create a new file.
<LI>process - run an arbitrary command to process the file, then create a
new file.
</UL>
<DD>Default: rename.

.item cycle-time
<DD>Specifies what time to cycle the log file.  This is used for the
'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', and 'monthly' cycle options.  It can specify a
number of minutes (past the hour), or a time in hours and minutes formatted
like this: 'hh:mm'.  For instance, if this is set to '03:30' and the cycle
option is 'daily', then the log file will be cycled at 3.30am each day.
<DD>Default: 00:00 (cycle at midnight).

.item cycle-day
<DD>Specifies the day of the week (for cycle=weekly) or the day of the month
(for cycle=monthly) to cycle the log file.  0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.
<DD>Default: 0.

.item cycle-size
<DD>Specifies the limit, in whole Kbytes, for the cycle=size option.  When
the log file exceeds this size, it will be cycled.
<DD>Default: 0.

.item cycle-lines
<DD>Specifies the limit, in lines, for the cycle=lines option.  When the log
file exceeds this size, it will be cycled.
<DD>Default: 

.item cycle-arg
<DD>Specifies an argument used for the various cycle-how options:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Cycle-how:  <TH>Uses argument like this:
<TR><TD>Rename      <TD>As time-stamped filename.
<TR><TD>Delete      <TD>Does not use argument.
<TR><TD>Move        <TD>As target directory name.
<TR><TD>Concat      <TD>As time-stamped filename.
<TR><TD>Process     <TD>As time-stamped command to execute.
</TABLE>
The time-stamping function expands symbols in the argument as follows:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Symbol:     <TH>Expands to give this:   
<TR><TD>%y          <TD>day of year, 001-366

<TR><TD>%s          <TD>second, 00-59
<TR><TD>%c          <TD>centisecond, 00-99
<TR><TD>%%          <TD>literal character %
</TABLE>
Additionally, when used for cycle-how=process, the argument can also contain
'%f', which is expanded to give the name of the old log file.
<DD>Default: ac%yy%mm%dd.log for the access log and er%yy%mm%dd.log for the
error log.

.item translate
<DD>Specifies whether the log file IP addresses are translated or not.
This can slow-down the server, especially if reverse-DNS lookups are not
working correctly, so always test this carefully before using it.  Note that
if translation is enabled, that you must configure the RDNS setup as
described in the section on $(*config_rdns="RDNS configuration").
<DD>Default: 0 (not enabled).
</DL>

<H3>Building Multilanguage Web Sites</H3>

<P>Xitami accepts the HTTP Accept-Language field and tries to do something
useful with it.  Not all browsers let you set this field, but some do.
This field lets users specify their preferences for particular versions of
documents.  For instance, if a user specifies that they prefer documents in
French, then English, the Accept-Language field will contain "fr, en".
Xitami handles this as follows, for a document URL "file.htm":
<UL>
<LI>If the file "file.htm" exists and is readable, Xitami returns it to the
browser as usual.
<LI>If the file does not exist, Xitami will search for "file.html",
"file.htm.fr", "file.htm_fr", "file.html.fr", "file.html_fr", "file.htm.en",
"file.htm_en", "file.html.en", and "file.html_en" in that order.
<LI>If the file is still not found, Xitami returns a 404 error status.
</UL>
<P>The same applies to default pages and to CGI scripts, and filters.  Note
that Xitami will only do the extra checking for alternative htm/html files
for .htm and .html files.


.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Configuration
.build anchor config_main

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Xitami will run straight out of the box with no configuration. However,
advanced users may want to modify Xitami's behaviour with respect to
security, CGI, logging, etc. Xitami reads a configuration file,
<EM>xitami.cfg</EM> to get information such as the logfile name and MIME
types. This is how the configuration files work:
<UL>
<LI>If no configuration file is present, Xitami will use internal defaults
for most values, including some basic MIME types. However a fuller list of
MIME types can come only from the config file.
<LI>The configuration file must be in the current directory, or on the PATH.
<LI>You can either modify the xitami.cfg file directly (not recommended) or
create a second file, <EM>defaults.cfg</EM>, and place modified values
there. This is an example of a defaults.cfg file:
<PRE>[Server]
    debug=1
</PRE>
<LI>The name 'defaults.cfg' can itself be modified in xitami.cfg.
<LI>Since the defaults.cfg file is not included in the Xitami distribution,
you will no longer lose customised configurations when you re-install the
web server.
<LI>If you change the defaults.cfg file it will be automatically reloaded by
the server after a short delay (usually 60 seconds). If you did not create
defaults.cfg, Xitami will auto-reload the xitami.cfg file.
<LI>Any command-line options (or control panel options for the GUI versions
of Xitami) <EM>override</EM> the options set in the configuration files.
</UL>

<P>In this document, configuration options are specified using the notation
<I>section:keyword</I>, for instance 'server:debug=1' for the file example
above.

<H3>Web-Based Administration (WBA) Interface</H3>

<P>The URL '/admin' will launch the WBA. This URL is password protected so
that it is inaccessible until you have specified a new password. To enable
the WBA you should modify xitami.aut and set a password for the [/admin]
URL. Note that xitami.aut is re-installed with each new version, so the
better long-term approach is to define a [Security]filename= option in
defaults.cfg.

<P>The WBA can be used in conjunction with this HTML-based help text, as
regards the various config options. At any time you can, of course, modify
the config files by hand.

<P>To disable the WBA, remove the xiadmin entry from the [WSX] section in
the xitami.cfg and default.cfg files.

<P>The URL '/setup' launches the virtual host WBA.  This works like the
standard WBA, but only lets you configure the look and feel for one virtual
host.  Xitami automatically launches the virtual host WBA for the correct
configuration file when you access the /setup URL through a virtual host.
The virtual host WBA does not let you change directories, define aliases, or
FTP options, and all options that impact the whole server are not shown.
This tool is designed for commercial hosting sites, and allows clients to
customise their website from a distance.  You can change the URL used to
access the virtual host WBA, in the WSX configuration section.

<H3>Configuration File Syntax</H3>

<P>A configuration file defines a series of sections, each containing
options. Comments are indicated by '#' at any point in the line. Blank lines
are ignored. Each option takes this form:
<PRE><EM>name</EM>=<EM>value</EM></PRE>

<P>The option <EM>name</EM> is case insensitive. You can put spaces around
the '=' if wanted. The option <EM>value</EM> is case-sensitive and may be
enclosed in double quotes if necessary. To specify an empty value, use "".
For example: <PRE>form-prefix=""</PRE>

<P>You can put references to environment variables in the configuration file
values using this syntax: $\(NAME). Note that the name must be in uppercase,
and that such references cannot be nested.

<P>Prior to version 2.4, Xitami used "_" and "-" interchangeably in the
config files; this is no longer the case, and Xitami uses "-" in all keys.

.include ../xiconfig.htp

.build anchor webmasks
<H3>Using Webmasks</H3>

<P>Xitami uses 'webmasks' to allow or deny access to resources.  The
simplest webmask is:
<PRE>webmask=*
</PRE>
which allows all IP addresses.  The '*' matches part or all of an IP
address, in this case, all addresses.

<P>To restrict accesses to local IP connections (i.e. originating from the
same system), use the form:
<PRE>webmask=local
</PRE>

<P>More complex webmasks consist of several terms, separated by commas.  For
example:
<PRE>webmask=192.*,!221.201.*,1.233.12.*
</PRE>

<P>To see whether the IP address of a client is allowed or rejected by a
webmask, Xitami starts with the first term, and looks at each term to see
whether it explicitly allows or denies the client IP address.  The order of
the terms is very important.  For example:
<PRE>webmask=!192.*,*
</PRE>
First rejects any addresses that start with '192.', and then allows all
(other) addresses.  A client connecting from '192.1.1.1' will be rejected by
the first term.

<P>However, the same two terms, exchanged, have a different effect:
<PRE>webmask=*,!192.*
</PRE>
Here, all clients are allowed by the first term, '*', and Xitami will not
even look at the second term.

<P>Lastly, you can put webmask information into a text file.  Use this form:
<PRE>webmask=@filename
</PRE>
Enter the webmask terms in the specified file, using whitespace or blank
lines freely. If the webmask file is not present, Xitami displays an error
message in its log files, and acts as if the webmask was not defined at all.

<H3>Using the Error Simulation Function</H3>

<P>Xitami lets you simulate a specific HTTP error, useful if you've defined
customised error messages. Use the special URL 'error?xxx' where 'xxx' is
the 3-digit HTTP error code you want to simulate. For instance, to simulate
a 402 error (Payment Required), use a URL like this:
http://localhost/error?402. You can simulate a 302 error (temporary
redirection) using a URL like this:
http://localhost/error?302:/somedir/somepage.htm. 

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Xitami supports CGI programs in Perl, C, or any other language
that your system supports.  In general, CGI program written for
web servers such as Apache and NCSA httpd will run unchanged with
Xitami.

<P>A 'CGI' program is considered to be any URL with '/cgi-bin'
somewhere in the path name.  These are all examples of valid
CGI program URLs:
<PRE>http://localhost/cgi-bin/myprog
http://localhost/cgi-bin/myprog.pl
http://localhost/products/install/cgi-bin/myprog</PRE>

<P>Xitami defines these CGI environment variables:
<UL>
<LI>For each HTTP header field, inserts a symbol called HTTP_xxxx
where xxxx is the header field name.  The field names are put
into uppercase, and hyphens replaced by underlines.
<LI>For each variable in the query string, inserts a symbol
called FORM_xxxx where xxxx is the variable name.
<LI>SERVER_SOFTWARE is the name of the web server.
<LI>SERVER_VERSION is the version of the web server ($(version)).
<LI>SERVER_NAME is the current host name.  This can be overridden by
defining a value for server:hostname.
<LI>SERVER_URL holds the full URL to the server.
<LI>SERVER_PORT is the port on which the current request was sent.
<LI>SERVER_HTTP_PORT is the current HTTP port (usually 80).
<LI>SERVER_HTTPS_PORT is the current HTTPS port (usually 443).
<LI>SERVER_PROTOCOL is the HTTP version in use (e.g. "HTTP/1.0").
<LI>SERVER_SECURITY is "SSL" for SSL connections, else "-".
<LI>SERVER_SSL_PORT is the port on which the web server is running
in SSL (HTTPS) mode, if SERVER_SECURITY is "SSL".
<LI>GATEWAY_INTERFACE is the CGI version in use (e.g. "CGI/1.1").
<LI>REQUEST_METHOD is the HTTP method used, "GET" or "POST".
<LI>QUERY_METHOD is same as the REQUEST_METHOD.
<LI>CONTENT_TYPE is the Content-Type: HTTP field.
<LI>CONTENT_LENGTH is the Content-Length: HTTP field.
<LI>REMOTE_USER is the authorised username, if any, else "-"; this
will only be set if the user has accessed a protected URL.
<LI>REMOTE_HOST is the same as REMOTE_ADDR.  Xitami does not
translate host addresses into names.
<LI>REMOTE_ADDR is the address of the remote host, "x.x.x.x".
<LI>SCRIPT_PATH is the path of the script being executed.
<LI>SCRIPT_NAME is the URI of the script being executed.
<LI>QUERY_STRING is the query string following the URL.
<LI>PATH_INFO is any path data following the CGI URL.
<LI>PATH_TRANSLATED is the full translated path with URL arguments.
<LI>CGI_ROOT is the CGI binary directory.
<LI>CGI_STDIN is the CGI standard input filename.
<LI>CGI_STDOUT is the CGI standard output filename.
<LI>CGI_STDERR is the CGI standard error filename, if any.
<LI>DOCUMENT_ROOT is the main webpages root directory.
</UL>
<P>A CGI program can get arguments from a number of places, depending on how
Xitami is configured and how the HTTP request is made.
<UL>
<LI>For GET requests, it is usual to follow the URL with '?' and some
arguments. These are passed to the CGI program in the QUERY_STRING variable.
The standard format for passing a number of variables in this way is (e.g.):
<PRE>http://hostname/cgi-bin/someprog?var1=value1&var2=value2...
</PRE>
<LI>If the arguments do not contain '=', they are broken into separate
arguments and passed to the CGI program that way too.  Each '+' in the query
string is used as a separator.  This may be used in a URL like this:
<PRE>http://hostname/cgi-bin/someprog?arg1+arg2+arg3...
</PRE>
<LI>Larger amounts of data should be passed using the POST method, in which
case the CGI program reads the data from its stdin stream.  (You can also
configure Xitami to pass these in the QUERY_STRING variable if the data is
not too large).
</UL>

<H3>CGI Programs Under 16-bit Windows</H3>

<P>The 16-bit Windows version of Xitami does not support CGI.

<H3>CGI Programs Under 32-bit Windows</H3>

<P>Under Windows 95 and NT, you can run different types of CGI programs:

<UL>
<LI>16-bit executable .exe files. You do not need to specify the .exe file
extension; Windows will correctly locate an .exe file. A bug in Windows 95
(we think) prevents 16-bit CGI programs from working when the Xitami server
is installed in a directory containing a long filename.

<LI>32-bit executable .exe files. The files do not actually need an .exe.
extension; Xitami will execute a file with any name so long as it is in the
CGI directory and 'looks' like an executable file (precisely: it must start
with the letters "MZ").

<LI>Perl programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "#!" followed by a space and the perl filename. The '.exe'
extension is optional. Perl must be installed on your system. For example,
if your Perl interpreter is located in c:\tools\perl you could start your
Perl program like this:
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl</PRE>
You can use '\' or '/' in the path name.  The Perl script should be
fully specified; Xitami does not assume any kind of extension.  Perl
programs sometimes end in '.pl'; we recommend you use no extension.
To provide compatibility with Perl scripts coming from UNIX, Xitami
will handle a path like '/usr/bin/perl' by removing '/usr/bin/' and
looking for PERL.EXE on the PATH, if /usr/bin/perl does not actually
exist as a file.
You can increase the speed of Perl CGI programs under Windows 95
by adding this definition to your system.ini file (this may also work
under NT; we've not tested it):
<PRE>[NonWindowsApp]
    CommandEnvSize=4096
</PRE>
This reserves memory for DOS applications, and you should make this
setting higher if you have plenty of RAM.

<LI>Awk scripts, and scripts in other UNIX-type languages that accept
comments starting with '#'. Start the script with '#! <interpreter name>' as
for Perl.

<LI>Visual Basic programs. Use the CGI_STDIN and CGI_STDOUT environment
variables to read the HTTP form data, and write the HTML output. You may
want to set cgi:form-fields to 0, since you can pick-up the HTTP form data
from the stdin file instead of the environment. Set cgi:form-query to 1 so
that you have access to the URL arguments if any. Set cgi:stdio to 0 so that
your CGI program has full access to the input and output files.

<LI>Rexx programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "/*!" followed by a space and the full filename for Rexx. The
'.exe' extension is optional. You can close the comment on the same line,
but the '*/' must be the last text on the line.

<LI>Batch files, although their usefulness is limited, since MS-DOS has
trouble with the HTML characters '&lt;' and '&gt;'. </UL>

<P>.com files should run correctly under 32-bit Windows. We recommend that
you use 32-bit executable programs, also called 'console programs'. The
Windows 32-bit interface is more robust and controlled than the 16-bit
interface. One example: if a CGI program loops, Xitami will kill it after a
timeout. But: a 16-bit DOS program will not respond to a kill request, and
will eventually bring the system down.

<H3>CGI Programs Under UNIX</H3>

<P>Under UNIX you can run any file that UNIX recognizes as an executable
file. This includes linked files, Perl scripts, shell scripts, etc.

<H3>CGI Programs Under OS/2</H3>

<P>Under OS/2, you can run different types of CGI programs:

<UL>
<LI>32-bit (and 16-bit) command-line based executable ".exe" files. You do
not need to specify the ".exe" file extension in the URL; Xitami for OS/2
will correctly locate an ".exe" CGI program. Starting PM-based executable
files through CGI is not supported.

<LI>REXX (and CMD) scripts. These files must have a ".cmd" extension, but
this does not have to be specified in the URL unless there is an executable
(".exe") of the same name in the directory (see the details of the search
order below). By default the script will be run by running the program
specified in the COMSPEC environment variable, followed by "/c scriptname",
so if your COMSPEC variable is set to "d:\os2\cmd.exe" then it will be run
as:

<PRE>d:\os2\cmd.exe /c scriptname</PRE>

<P>Optionally you can specify a different interpreter for the script by
using either:
<UL>
  <LI>The OS/2 EXTPROC syntax:
      <PRE>EXTPROC full-path-to-interpreter flags</PRE>
      in the first line of the script file (Xitami will accept flags at
      the end of the EXTPROC line by some other programs may not; test
      carefully); or
  <LI>A special REXX comment:
      <PRE>/*! full-path-to-interpreter flags */</PRE>
      in the first line of the script file.  You can use the standard OS/2
      command interpreter (CMD.EXE) as the interpreter for REXX, but if you
      do then you must specify "/c" as one of the flags to ensure
      the command interpreter exits as soon as the CGI script finishes
      running.
</UL>

<P>Remember the REXX scripts are identified by the "/*" comment in their
first line. The full-path-to-interpreter should specify the full filename
(drive (if it is not on the same drive as everything else), path, and
filename) of the interpreter to use.

<LI>Perl programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "#!" followed by a space and the full filename for Perl. For
example if your perl interpreter is "c:\tools\perl.exe" you should start
your Perl program like this:
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl.exe</PRE>
or
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl</PRE>
You can use '\' or '/' in the path name. The programs are best stored in a
file without an extension, or in a file with a ".cmd" extension; if you use
another extension you will need to specify the whole filename (including the
extension) in the URL. Perl must be installed on your system. Perl 5.004 is
recommended. If your perl script uses special features make sure you are
running the correct perl executable (check the Perl 5.004 for OS/2
documentation) for the features you require.

<LI>Awk scripts, and scripts in other UNIX-type languages that accept
comments starting with '#'. Begin the script with '#! <interpreter name>' as
for Perl.
</UL>

<P>When searching for a CGI program to run, if the program specified has no
extension Xitami for OS/2 first tries adding a ".exe" extension, then if
that fails it tries adding a ".cmd;" extension. If both of those fail, or
the program name already has an extension, the name is tried as is; it will
be considered executable if it has a ".exe" extension, a ".cmd" extension or
the file starts with a "#!" comment line. (REXX scripts and CMD scripts must
be stored in files with a ".cmd" extension because that is all the command
interpter (CMD.EXE) will accept.)

<P>It is not possible to run DOS executables (".exe" or ".com") or DOS batch
files (".bat") under Xitami for OS/2. Nor is it possible to run PM-based
programs as CGI programs.

.build anchor cgidir
<H3>CGI Directories</H3>

<P>You can specify an alternate CGI directory. By default, Xitami will
search a subdirectory called 'cgi-bin'. This is how Xitami translates a URL
into an absolute file path, when looking for the CGI program:

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TH>'cgi-bin' option:
    <TH>URL:
    <TH>Final pathname:
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>./cgi-bin/products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>/web/cgibin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>/web/cgibin/products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>./products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
</TABLE>

<P>This translation works as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If the URL starts with '/cgi-bin' this text is removed, and
the remainder of the path is attached to the 'cgi-bin' option to
give a full path name.
<LI>If the URL does not start with '/cgi-bin', the complete URL
path is attached to the 'webpages' directory to give a file path.
</UL>
<P>Only one of these translations can be done.  By consequence,
any value you specify for the 'cgi-bin' option is ignored if you
place the '/cgi-bin' directory at some deeper level in the URL.
This is useful if you intend to mix CGI programs with your HTML
files, as complete directories.

<H3>CGI Error Messages</H3>

<P>Xitami tries to explain why a CGI program fails; these are the different
messages you may see for a 500 error, with an explanation for each.

<H4>Insufficient resources to run this CGI program</H4>
<P>There is not enough memory available.  This is a bad sign; it means
that the virtual memory available to Xitami is all full.  Stop the
web server, modify your systems' virtual memory settings, and start it
up again.  This problem is very rare, really, especially since Xitami
is a tiny piece of software.

<H4>CGI arguments are too long - request was refused</H4>
<P>The CGI URL argument (text following a '?' after the URL) was too
long.  Whatever you are trying to do, stop it.  (Actually, since release
1.2a, Xitami allocates such buffers dynamically, so this error will not
occur, and it is now rather difficult to hack Xitami by using buffer
overruns.)

<H4>Cannot create stdin stream for CGI</H4>
<P>Xitami communicates with CGI processes using simple text files; if
the file it wants to use already exists and is unavailable to Xitami, it
will not be able to run the CGI process.  Cure: make sure that you only
run one instance of Xitami from one directory.  Delete any files called
'tmp...'.  Make sure no CGI process is still hanging around, looping but
unkillable (typically under Windows 95 or NT with 16-bit CGIs).

<H4>Cannot create CGI process - program not found</H4>
<P>The CGI program exists (otherwise you get a 402 Not Found), but could
not be started correctly.  The most common cause of this error is a Perl
script which has a misformed magic header line.  Make sure that the Perl
script starts with "#! perlpath" where <EM>perlpath</EM> is the full
path name of the Perl executable, e.g. "C:\Perl\Perl.exe".

<H4>CGI process ended with an error status</H4>
<P>The CGI program ran, but returned an error code.  Most servers ignore
this, but Xitami treats this as an error.  Cure: make sure your CGI
programs end correctly with a 'return (0)' or equivalent.  If you cannot
do this, set the configuration option cgi:exit-ok to 0.

<H4>CGI process was interrupted before ending</H4>
<P>Someone or something interrupted the CGI process before it ended.
This can happen when a CGI process takes too long to run, and the system
administrator decides that enough is enough, and kills it.  Cure: ask
your sysadmin to be nice, or write faster CGIs.

<H4>Internal server error while running CGI</H4>
<P>Something unexpected happened inside Xitami's guts when it tried to
run your CGI.  Aaaagh!  What did you do?!  If this happens, let us know
how to reproduce it.

<H4>Undetermined error</H4>
<P>Something else happened.  Cure: tell us about it.

.page Server-Side Includes (SSI)
.build anchor using_ssi

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>SSI (server-side includes) is a fairly standard syntax which you can read
about on the $(*ssi=NCSA_site). By default, Xitami parses any document with
extension '.ssi', '.shtm', or '.shtml' as an SSI document. This is defined
in the $(*config_wsx=[WSX]) section of the configuration files, where the
SSI WSX agent is xixssi. You can add SSI support to other file types, e.g.
for .html files. SSI documents are placed in the normal web pages directory,
and are recognised purely by their extension, not the path.

<P>Xitami supports these SSI tags:
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Element syntax:<TH>Effect:
<TR><TD>#config errmsg="<I>text</I>"
    <TD>Specify the SSI error message.
<TR><TD>#config sizefmt="<I>format</I>"
    <TD>Specify whether file sizes are shown in full, or abbreviated.  Use
    the format 'abbrev' to show abbreviated sizes.
<TR><TD>#config timefmt="<I>format</I>"
    <TD>Specify the format used for file times.  By default this is:
    "%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z".
<TR><TD>#echo var="<I>variable</I>"
    <TD>Output the value of the specified variable.  Xitami recognises these
    variables: DOCUMENT_NAME, DOCUMENT_URI, DATE_GMT, DATE_LOCAL,
    LAST_MODIFIED, and any environment variable (including the standard CGI
    environment variables).
<TR><TD>#exec cgi="<I>pathname</I>"
    <TD>Outputs the result of the CGI program, which must be in the CGI
    binary directory (it cannot be on a CGI alias directory).  Note that the
    CGI program runs in the main Xitami directory.
<TR><TD>#exec cmd="<I>command</I>"
    <TD>Executes a native command and includes the output of this command.
    Note that the command runs in the main Xitami directory.  This SSI
    command - which is a potential security risk for your system - is only
    accepted if the ssi:exec configuration option is enabled.
<TR><TD>#include virtual="<I>filename</I>"
    <TD>Includes the contents of the specified URI, which is assumed to be
    within the webpages root.
<TR><TD>#include file="<I>filename</I>"
    <TD>Includes the contents of the specified file, which may be anywhere
    in the file system space.
<TR><TD>#flastmod {virtual|file}="<I>filename</I>"
    <TD>Outputs the time that the specified file was last modified.  The
    file can be a URI within the webpages root, or an absolute filename,
    depending on whether 'virtual' or 'file' is specified.
<TR><TD>#fsize {virtual|file}="<I>filename</I>"
    <TD>Outputs the size of the specified URL or file, using the sizefmt.
</TABLE>


.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Filters
.build anchor filters

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Filters are
programs that are run with the (usually) HTML file as input.  You
can write filters in Perl, Awk, C, Rexx, or any other language that
can handle standard input/output streams.  Filters are a little
like CGI programs, except that they are invoked whenever a certain
type of file is requested.

<P>Each definition in this section consists of a file extension with a
leading dot and a command. The command may be with a full path, or without,
if the program is on the PATH. Xitami lets you run scripts directly under
OS/2 and Windows 95/NT, if you respect the header conventions noted in the
CGI section.

<P>You can pass any type of input file to a filter program, with the
restriction that it must be a text file. Binary files will probably not work
under MS-DOS-like file systems. Under Unix there is no difference between
text and binary files.
<P>Xitami supports filter programs in Perl, C, or any other language that
your system supports. A filter program runs when the HTML page is displayed,
unlike a CGI program, which runs when the user posts data from a HTML form.
An example of a filter program is PHP 3.0, which Xitami supports.

<P>To add your own filter programs, you add an entry in the [Filter] section
of the config file. A filter program is invoked whenever a file with the
appropriate extension is displayed.

<P>Filter programs need to respect the rules for CGI programs. That is, they
should generate the same type of header (Content-Type: text/html). Filter
programs also get the standard CGI environment, and are subject to the CGI
timeouts and other constraints set in the [CGI] section.

<P>When you POST to a filter program, the form data is supplied on the
standard input as for CGI programs.  When you use the GET method, the file
that is being filtered is provided on the standard input.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Server-Side XML Processing
.build anchor using_xml

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>XML is a data-definition language, used more and more to describe data
coming from databases and other places.  Xitami can produce XML logfiles,
and uses XML in other places.

<P>With server-side XML processing, you can display XML files as HTML
quickly and easily, with full control over the HTML that is produced.
Xitami's XML processing is simpler and more powerful than stylesheets or
other ways of processing XML.

<P>Server-side XML processing is an excellent way to show data coming from
databases, other applications, spreadsheets, and so on. All you need to do
is to create the data in an XML format and write a GSL script that processes
it (as described below).

<H3>The GSL Language</H3>

<P>Xitami uses the GSL language to describe how an XML file is shown. GSL
is iMatix's Open Source template-based code-generation language. The GSLgen
engine is built-in to Xitami, and GSLgen is also provided as a seperate
command-line tool with Xitami.

<P>If you want to use server-side XML processing, you should download the
$(*gsl=GSLgen) tool from imatix.com, and study the GSL language.  It's
quite simple.  This is an example GSL script, provided as an example in
the webpages directory:

<PRE>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Client Summary&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At $\(date) $\(time)
\.for client
&lt;H3&gt;$(name:)&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;$\(address:)
&lt;TABLE WIDTH="50%"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Date:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Quantity:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Delivered:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
\.define total = 0
\.for order
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$\(date:)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$\(quantity:)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$\(delivered:)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
\.define total = total + quantity
\.endfor
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Total ordered: $\(total)
\.endfor
&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

<P>By default, Xitami uses a script with the same name as the XML file (but
with the extension .gsl).  You can use a specific script by adding an
attribute 'script' to the root item, e.g.:

<PRE>&lt;data script = "testxml.gsl" &gt;
</PRE>

<P>This is useful if you process several XML files through the same script.

<H3>Preparing Output From CGIs</H3>

<P>One handy way to use XML files is in combination with CGIs.  Your CGI
program can create an XML file, then use the 302 HTTP code to redirect the
request to the XML file.

<H3>Predefined Attributes</H3>

<P>As well as the standard attributes (date, time, filename, script), the
GSL script can access all the environment variables normally passed to a
CGI program, such as REMOTE_USER.

<H3>Passing Arguments to The XML File</H3>

<P>You can pass arguments to the the XML file processor by using the
query string syntax:
<PRE>http://xx.xx.xx.xx/myfile.xml?arg=value;arg=value;...</PRE>
<P>This is useful to override attributes like 'script'.  All arguments
passed in the query string are defined in the XML root item.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Server-Side GSL Scripting
.build anchor using_gsl

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>GSL is the iMatix code generation language.  You can use GSL to do
fast server-side scripting, using an approach similar server-side includes
(SSI).  GSL supports many commands including XML-driven output.

<P>Server-side GSL scripting is similar to $(*using_xml=XML processing),
but the GSL script invoked directly (e.g. http://hostname/somefile.gsl)
instead indirectly through an XML file.  GSL files must have the extension
'.gsl'.

<H3>Why use GSL Scripts?</H3>

<P>For many cases, GSL scripting is faster and simpler than SSI or CGI.
A GSL script can load and manipulate arbitrarily-complex XML data, and
convert this into usable HTML using a simple but powerful template
language.  GSL is several years ahead of similar approaches like XSLT
(the XML Stylesheet Language Transformation language), and works today
directly from your Xitami web server.

<H3>Predefined Attributes</H3>

<P>As well as the standard attributes (date, time, filename, script), the
GSL script can access all the environment variables normally passed to a
CGI program, such as REMOTE_USER.  These are defined as attributes of the
root item, as well as 'argument' items attached to the root item.

<H3>Passing Arguments to The GSL Script</H3>

<P>You can pass arguments to the the GSL script by using the
query string syntax:
<PRE>http://xx.xx.xx.xx/myfile.xml?arg=value;arg=value;...</PRE>
<P>All arguments passed in the query string are defined as attributes
of the XML root item.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Image Maps

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Xitami supports NCSA-type clickable image maps.  When an image
has the ISMAP attribute, Xitami will search for and use an image
map file if the browser cooperates.  An image map file has the name
of the image, the extension .map, and this syntax:
<UL>
<LI>Lines starting with # are ignored.
<LI>Blank lines are ignored.
<LI>Data lines consist of an element type, a URL, and optionally a
list of coordinates, separated by spaces.
</UL>
<P>The URL can be any Internet URL, either an absolute image map,
or a relative image map.  Xitami will recognise and handle these
types of URLs:
<UL>
<LI>A filename with no path.  Xitami prefixes the path of the
image map file.
<LI>A filename with a path.  Xitami prefixes "http://", the name
of the server host, and the port number if that is not 80.
<LI>An absolute URL, starting with http: or another scheme
such as mailto:, ftp:, etc.
</UL>
<P>You can use these elements types in the image map:
<TABLE>
<TR NOWRAP>
<TH>Element syntax:
<TH>Effect:
<TR NOWRAP>
<TD><TT>default</TT> <EM>url</EM>
<TD>Defines the default URL for the image.
<TR NOWRAP>
<TD><TT>rect</TT> <EM>url</EM> <EM>x1,y1</EM>
<EM>x2,y2</EM>
<TD>Defines a rectangle between the two corner points
specified.  Assumes x2 >= x1, y2 >= y1.
<TR NOWRAP>
<TD><TT>circle</TT> <EM>url</EM> <EM>x1,y1</EM>
<EM>x2,y2</EM>
<TD>Defines a circle where (x1,y1) is the circle's
center, and (x2,y2) is any point on its circumference.
<TR NOWRAP>
<TD><TT>point</TT> <EM>url</EM> <EM>x,y</EM>
<TD>Defines a point.  Accepts a click within about 3
pixels of the point.
<TR NOWRAP>
<TD><TT>poly</TT> <EM>url</EM> <EM>x,y</EM>...
<TD>Defines a polygon, where (x1,y1)..(xn,yn) defines
the perimeter of the polygon.  You can specify up to 100
points.
</TABLE>

<P>There are many freely-available tools to help you create
image maps.  Xitami is compatible with these tools, so long as
you create the image map in NSCA format.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Virtual Hosts
.build anchor vhosts

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Setting-up A Virtual Host</H3>

<P><EM>Virtual hosts</EM> means running multiple virtual web sites on
one system.  This is commonly used by web site providers, but can be
useful in all kinds of organisations.  There are two ways to configure
your IP system to permit virtual hosting:
<OL>
<LI>You can assign multiple IP addresses to a system, a technique that
is called 'multihoming'.  An IP address refers to a connection point
(e.g. a network card) to a system, rather than the system itself, so
it's quite normal to have multiple IP addresses.  Many network cards can
support multiple addresses (4 or 8), and most systems can take multiple
network cards.  There are probably routers and gateways that make it
possible to have thousands of IP addresses on one system.
<LI>You can assign the same IP address to lots of host names, using DNS
or something similar.  Thus, 'www1.some.domain' and 'www2.some.domain'
can refer to the same address. This is often called a 'virtual host'
because the host does not exist as a separate computer, just as a name.
</OL>

<P>Xitami can work with both these mechanisms for HTTP and FTP connections.
It handles multiple IP addresses automatically: if you ask it to run on
port 80, it will accept connections on any IP address, on port 80. You do
not need to configure this (although you can restrict it to run on one
specific address). This means that you do not need to specify on which IP
address Xitami should accept connections - if a system has ten IP
addresses, Xitami will accept connections on all ten.

<P>A multihomed virtual host is identified by its IP address. A DNS-based
virtual host is identified by its name:

<PRE>[Virtual-Hosts]
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx=filename.cfg   #  A multihomed host
    www.some.domain=filename.cfg   #  A DNS-based virtual host
</PRE>

<P>DNS-based virtual hosting requires a DNS server or something similar. The
mechanisms for setting-up both multiple IP addresses and multiple domain
names are system-specific; you should have access to technical documentation
for your TCP/IP configuration or good technical support. DNS-based virtual
hosting uses a HTTP/1.1 feature called the 'Host:' header, and an FTP feature
whereby the user name is specified as 'user@<I>hostname</I>'.  Most modern
browsers support this; if you are building an intranet it is quite easy to
be sure that all browsers will work correctly with DNS-based virtual
hosting. On the Internet you can catch browsers that do not send a valid
Host: header, and show some specific pages.

<P>The SSL protocol used in Xitami/Pro cannot work with DNS-based
virtual hosts, so to use SSL virtual hosts you must have a unique IP address
for each host.

<P>When you set-up a virtual host, you will generally want to use a specific
directory for the web pages, CGI scripts, password file, and log files. (You
can also share these in any way you need to.) You can also configure options
such as the HTTP error messages, timeouts, security, and so on.

<P>To define these, you specify a configuration file per virtual host. The
virtual host configuration inherits all definitions from defaults.cfg (and
xitami.cfg). You need only define those options that are specific to the
virtual host. If the HTTP request refers to a host name or IP address that
has not been configured as a virtual host, the request is handled by the
<EM>base host</EM>. To configure the base host, create a file called
'basehost.cfg'. You can change this name in the defaults.cfg file
server:base-host option.

<P>This is a typical configuration for a site with several virtual hosts:
<PRE>[Server]
    webpages=websites/hostx/webpages
    cgi-bin=websites/hostx/cgi-bin
</PRE>

<P>Some of the options in the [Server] apply to the entire server globally,
and are not taken from the virtual host configuration file: background,
customise, debug, limit, portbase, and refresh.

<P>When you define a multihomed virtual host, you must specify a
server:hostname value. This should be a host name that translates back into
the correct IP address. The server:hostname option is used whenever Xitami
has to return a 'redirected' URL; for image maps, incomplete URL, and
directory listings. If you do not define server:hostname, or define it
wrongly, these functions may not work.

<P>When you define a DNS-based virtual host, Xitami takes the name as a
default value for the server:hostname option. This usually works correctly,
but you can override it if necessary by adding the server:hostname option
explicitly. To avoid confusion, make sure your DNS server is correctly
configured. You normally use 'ping' to test that this works.

<P>The virtual host configuration files, must exist when the server
starts-up. You can modify the virtual host configurations on-the-fly, as for
the normal configuration files, but if you want to add or remove a virtual
host you must stop and restart the server (for instance using the WBA
control panel.)

<H3>Debugging Virtual Hosts</H3>

<P>Since virtual hosting means playing with a lot of config files,
this can quickly become confusing if you don't take some basic care
and precautions.  We advise you to:
<UL>
<LI>Keep the extension .cfg for all config files.  This lets you
distinguish the config files from other files.
<LI>Use filenames that match the host name.
<LI>Use a directory structure that matches the host names.
<LI>Only specify those options that are not the defaults.  This
allows you to focus on the specific virtual-host options that
you've defined.
</UL>

<P>If you have 'not found' errors that you can't explain, set the
server:debug option to 1 and recreate the error. Then, the log files
'debug.log' contains detailled information about the URL translation. You
can look at this file, or in serious cases, send it to us and we'll try to
help.

.page The FTP Service

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>Xitami supports the FTP (file transfer) protocol. The FTP service was
designed to be simple and easy to administer, while providing the security
and speed necessary for a web site. You can administer the FTP service from
the WBA screens, in the same way as you administer the rest of Xitami.

<P>The current implementation of FTP does not support virtual hosts, so the
FTP configuration applies to all virtual hosts defined for a web site.

<P>The FTP service recognises these commands, and handles those not marked
by '*':
<PRE>
 USER    PASV    STOU*   MAIL*   ALLO*   CWD     PWD     XMKD

</PRE>

<H3>FTP Configuration Options</H3>

<P>The configuration of the FTP service is handled by specific
sections in the standard configuration file.

.build anchor config_ftp
<H4>The [FTP] Section</H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP service.
<DL>
.item enabled
<DD>Specifies whether the FTP service is enabled or not. If you change this
option you must stop and restart the server for it to take effect. (The WBA
control panel 'Restart' action will not start the FTP service.)
<DD>Default: 1 (enabled).

.item root
<DD>Specifies the root directory for FTP logins, unless a specific
directory is defined for the current user.
<DD>Default: ftproot (below main Xitami directory).

.item port
<DD>Specifies the FTP connection port.  The port is shifted by the
portbase specified for the main HTTP service.  For instance if you
specify a port 21, and a portbase of 8000, your server will accept
FTP connections on port 8021 and HTTP connections on port 8080.
<DD>Default: 21 (the standard FTP port).

.item timeout
<DD>Specifies the time in seconds after which inactive control connections
are closed. An FTP session requires one control connection, plus one data
connection during file transfers. You should tune this timeout to suit the
requirements of your system. For instance, under an OS like Windows 95,
sockets are a limited resource, so a shorter timeout is a good idea. For
sites with a small user group, you can use high timeouts, which users
generally prefer.
<DD>Default: 300 (5 minutes)

.item limit
<DD>Specifies the maximum number of users that may login at once. On systems
that can handle lots of open sockets (e.g. Unix, OS/2, WinNT, Win98), you
may want to increase this. Xitami does not impose any fixed limit. If you
set this value to 0, it means 'no limit'.
<DD>Default: 25 users.
</DL>

.item user-file
<DD>Specifies the name of the user definition file. The syntax for this is
described below.
<DD>Default: ftpusers.aut.

.item directory-file
<DD>Specifies the name of the directory definition file.  The syntax for
this is described below.
<DD>Default: ftpdirs.aut.

.item dirsort
<DD>Specifies the sort order for directory listings.  You can sort by
file name, extension, size, or modification date/time using any combination
of the letters 'n', 'x', 's', and 't'.  For instance, dirsort=xnt will sort
by extension, then name, then time.  To sort in reverse order, use capital
letters.  For instance to show the most recent files first, use dirsort=T.
<DD>Default: n (sort by name).

.item message-script
<DD>Specifies the $(*gsl=GSL) script that is used to format FTP messages.
If you use this option, Xitami ignores the welcome, signoff, and login-text
options.  You can edit the script to customise welcome and error messages.
Look at the default script for a full description of the attributes you can
use.
<DD>Default: templates/ftpmesg.gsl.

.item welcome
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user connects to the FTP server.
This can be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'. The file
can contain up to 2000 characters. Any lines that start with '#' are ignored
as comments. If you modify this file, it is safest to make a copy (call it
welcome.txt or something) and change this option to refer to the changed
file. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you reinstall the next latest
greatest version of Xitami.
<DD>Default: @ftphello.txt (an example file).

.item signoff
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user ends the FTP session. This can
be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'. The file can
contain up to 2000 characters. Any lines that start with '#' are ignored as
comments. If you modify this file, it is safest to make a copy (call it
goodbye.txt or something) and change this option to refer to the changed
file. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you reinstall the next latest
greatest version of Xitami.
<DD>Default: @ftpadios.txt (an example file).

.item login-text
<DD>Specifies a text to be shown when a user logs-in to the FTP server.
This can be literal text, or the name of a file, preceded by '@'.  The
file can contain up to 2000 characters.  Any lines that start with '#'
are ignored as comments.  If you modify this file, it is safest to make
a copy (call it login.txt or something) and change this option to
refer to the changed file.  Xitami will search for this file first in
the user's login directory, then in the main Xitami directory.
<DD>Default: @ftplogin.txt (an example file).

.item user-at-host
<DD>This flag controls whether Xitami allows virtual hosts using the syntax
'username@hostname'.  This syntax is supported by some FTP clients, and
allows you to use multiple FTP virtual hosts on a single IP address.
<DD>Default: 1 (enabled).

.item email-check
<DD>If 1, the FTP server will check that the e-mail address supplied
for anonymous logins is a valid address.  The nature of the check is
not documented (it may just look for an '@' in the address).
<DD>Default: 0 (do not check addresses).

.item http-aliases
<DD>Specifies whether the HTTP [Alias] section should be used by the
FTP service.  This can be useful in configurations where you want to
share the same data between services, but it can be a security risk
if you want to use FTP aliases to access directories outside the HTTP
space.
<DD>Default: 0 (disabled).

.item soft-quota
<DD>Specifies the default soft quota for FTP users who are subject to a
quota.  You can also specify quota values for individual users.  This
value is specified in megabytes, as a decimal number (using a decimal
point, not comma, even in Europe).  When a user exceeds their soft quota,
they start getting warning messages.
<DD>2.5

.item hard-quota
<DD>Specifies the default hard quota for FTP users who are subject to a
quota.  You can also specify quota values for individual users.  This
value is specified in megabytes, as a decimal number.  When a user exceeds
their hard quota, they cannot upload new files.
<DD>2.5

.item webmask
<DD>Specifies the set of clients that can connect to the FTP server.
The section on $(*webmasks) provides more details.

.item password-case
<DD>If 1, FTP passwords are case-sensitive.  If 0, passwords are always
converted to lower-case before validation. If you set this to 0, be sure to
use only lower-case passwords in the password file.
<DD>Default: 1 (case-sensitive)

.item data-port
<DD>Specifies the port at which data connections will be made.  Xitami
scans for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of ports.
The port is shifted by whatever value was used for the server portbase.
<DD>Default: 200.

.item force-ip
<DD>Indicates whether passive connections must be forced to the IP
address specified in the 'ipaddress' option.
<DD>Default: 0 (do not force).

.item ipaddress
<DD>The IP address used for passive connections.  If '*', accepts passive
connections on all local available IP addresses.
<DD>Default: '*'.
</DL>

.build anchor config_ftplog
<H4>The [FTPLog] Section</H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP access log.
<DL>
.item enabled
<DD>Specifies whether FTP accesses are logged or not.  FTP accesses are
logged in a format similar to that used for HTTP accesses.
<DD>Default: 1 (accesses are logged).

.item filename
<DD>Specifies the filename for access logging.  This may be the same as
the main HTTP access log file.
<DD>Default: access.log.

.item cycle
<DD>Specifies the cycle mode for the log file.
<DD>Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour;
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day;
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week;
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month, or
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only.
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

.item local
<DD>Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.
<DD>Default: 1 (include local addresses).
</DL>

.build anchor config_ftp_alias
<H4>The [FTP-Alias] Section</H4>

<P>This section lets you define multiple FTP file roots.  Each alias
alias specifies a name and a path.  For example:
<PRE>[FTP-Alias]
volume-c=C:\
</PRE>
<P>The alias name itself may not contain '/'. It is not case sensitive. FTP
aliases are only shown to 'root' users, i.e. those with an empty root value,
or those who have the 'aliases=1' option defined (see below). Like HTTP
aliases, the FTP alias is always the first component of a filename (e.g.
/volume-c/somefile).  Aliases are shown only if the user has no GET access,
and if the specified user's root directory actually exists.

.build anchor config_ftperrlog
<H4>The [FTPErrLog] Section</H4>

<P>This section controls the FTP error log.
<DL>
.item enabled
<DD>Specifies whether FTP errors are logged or not.  FTP errors are
logged in a format similar to that used for HTTP errors.
<DD>Default: 1 (errors are logged).

.item filename
<DD>Specifies the filename for error logging. This may be the same as
the main HTTP error log file.
<DD>Default: error.log.

.item cycle
<DD>Specifies the cycle mode for the log file.
<DD>Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour;
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day;
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week;
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month, or
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only.
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

.item local
<DD>Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.
<DD>Default: 1 (include local addresses).
</DL>

.build anchor config_ftp_users
<H3>FTP User File Syntax</H3>

<P>The FTP user file defines all users that may log-in to the FTP
server.  This is a typical user file:

<PRE>
[Admin]
    Access=*
    Password=-
    Root=""
    Aliases=1           #   Will have access to aliases
[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=pub
[Guest]
    Access=G
    Root=c:\public\guest
[Upload]
    Access=P
    Password=upload
    Root=/tempfiles/upload
    Use-quotas=1
    Soft-quota=10
    Hard-quota=12
</PRE>

<P>The user name is specified like this: [Admin].  User names are
not case-sensitive.  The password may be any text.  The password
may be one of these special values:
<UL>
<LI>"*" - accepts anonymous logins.  If ftp:check-email is set to
1, will check that the password looks like a valid e-mail address.
<LI>"-" - rejects all logins for this user.  You can use this to
disable an account temporarily.  This is the default password for
accounts where no password is defined.
<LI>"" (blank) - does not ask for a password.  Use this only for
low-security (guest) accounts.
</UL>

<P>The access rights are any combination of:
<UL>
<LI>'G' - The user can list directories and get files from the server
<LI>'P' - The user can upload (put) files to the server.
<LI>'U' - The user can upload files to the server, but not overwrite
existing files.
<LI>'D' - The user can delete files on the server, and can rename files.
<LI>'M' - The user can create directories
<LI>'R' - The user can remove directories
<LI>'*' - The user can do everything (same as GPUDMR).
<LI>'-' - The user can do nothing; this can be used to disable access to a
specific alias, for instance.
</UL>

<P>The 'root' option defines where the user can work. If this is not
specified, the user can work anywhere below the FTP root directory. You can
also specify a full path, for instance:
<PRE>root=/home/users/guest
</PRE>

<P>The 'aliases' option defines whether or not a user has access to the
FTP aliases.  By default this is true for all 'root' users, i.e. those
with an empty root value.  You can override this default by specifying
an explicit value for the aliases option.

<P>Note that put-only directories should be treated as special cases, and
used only as a user's root directory.  You cannot 'chdir' to a put-only
directory.

<P>You can enable/disable quotas per user. We defined a 'soft quota' and a
'hard quota'.  Above the soft quota, the user gets warning messages. Above
the hard limit, uploads are refused, and warnings are sent to the web
server console.  The quota is calculated quite simply: it is the limit for
all files in the user's login directory and subdirectories. You can
therefore share a quota between users, or allocate a quota to individual
users. The site administrator can decide whether log files are part of the
quota or not, by putting them into the user's space, or into separate
(non-quota) directories.  For quotas to work, keep a user limited to the
login subtree.  I.e. do not allow writeable aliases.  Quotas are managed by
the three configuration keys: use-quota, soft-quota, and hard-quota.

<P>The 'pipe' option lets you specify a $(*pipes=throttle pipe) for this
account. You can define a default pipe for the entire FTP server. To
specify that an account uses no pipe (runs at full speed) while a default
pipe is defined for the server, specify the pipe name "-".

<H3>FTP Directory File Syntax</H3>

<P>The FTP directory file defines access rights per user for specific
directories. Each section is a directory name; either an absolute directory
(e.g. [/pub]) or a child of the ftproot directory (specified without a
leading slash: [pub]).  To define rights for an alias directory, you must
use the child's root directory plus the alias directory.  For instance if
you define an aliase like 'info' which maps to a CD-ROM drive, protection
for a user 'guest' who's initial root directory is 'guest' looks like this:
<PRE>[guest/info]
</PRE>

<P>For instance, if the guest user has access to aliases, but you want to
disable access to the 'info' alias, you could use an entry like this:
<PRE>[guest/info]
guest=-
</PRE>

<P>A directory entry covers all child directories, unless a more
specific directory is defined for that user.  Directory names are not
case significant.

<P>Each entry specifies access rights for a user; the user must have
been defined in the FTP users file.  The same access right codes are
used.

<H3>An Example FTP Configuration</H3>

<P>This material for this section was provided by Paul C. Fretz,
&lt;pcfretz@mha.shalom.k12.pa.us&gt;.

<P>Install Xitami in its own directory.  Have your web pages in a
separate directory such as c:\webpages

<P>Setup 'defaults.cfg' to include:
<PRE>[Server]
    Webpages=c:\webpages
[Ftp]
    Root=c:\webpages
    welcome="Welcome"                   #   text or @filename
    login-text="Login"                  #   text or @filename
    user-file=ftpulist.aut              #   Users authorization file
[Security]
    password-case=1                     #   Case-sensitive passwords
    filename=password.aut               #   Authorization file
<PRE>

<P>Setup 'ftpulist.aut' to include:
<PRE>[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=AnonFTP
[WEBRoot]
    Access=G
    Password=123456
    Root=""
[U101]
   Access=GPDMR
   Password=123101
   Root=User/U101
[U102]
   Access=GPDMR
   Password=123102
   Root=User/U102
</PRE>

<P>There are several things to keep in mind:
<OL>
<LI>The directory structure for the above is as follows:
<PRE>c:\webpages
       |-AnonFTP
       |-User
          |-U101
          |-U102
          |-...
</PRE>
<LI>For FTP access to c:\webpages\User\U101 the userid is U101 and the
password is 123101.
<LI>The WEBRoot entry gives FTP 'get' access to your whole website.
</OL>

<P>Setup 'password.aut' as follows if you want to password protect the same
subdirectories for browsing:
<PRE>
[/admin]
    Admin=-             #   By default, admin access is disabled
    Webmask=local       #   <== when 'local', remote access is not allowed
[User/U101]
   U101=123101
[User/U102]
   U102=123102
</PRE>

<OL>
<LI>'Admin=-' disables web-based administration. Change this if you wish.
<LI>When you try to access with your browser anything located in
c:\webpages\User\U101 (by using http://yourdomain/User/U101/) the browser
will ask for user name and password. The username is U101 and the password
is 123101. The first line [User/U101] refers to the subdirectory. The second
line U101=123101 is the user name and password and does not have to be
anything like the first line.
<LI>A scheme like this allows users to have their own private subdirectory
on the web server. They can access just theirs by FTP using Netscape or a
program like WS-FTP. These pages are then available for anyone to browse
or if you protect them as shown above in 'password.aut', they are private.
<LI>Note that the default Xitami configuration requires that CGIs start with
the string '/cgi-bin'.  The above configuration does not allow users to
upload and run arbitrary CGIs, something that usually presents a security
risk.
</OL>

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page The Dynamic DNS Feature
.build anchor ddns

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>What is Dynamic DNS?</H3>

<P>Dynamic DNS is a way of registering your computer on the Internet
domain-name system (DNS) even when you have a dial-up line or cable modem,
with an IP address that changes each time you connect. Without a DDNS
service, people using your server must know and type its IP number. With a
DDNS service, they can use the domain name.

<P>Dynamic DNS services vary a lot in qualty.  Free services, like the now
defunct Monolith service, are often heavily loaded and can be slow to
update.  Commercial services cost from $25 upwards per year, and offer two
main advantages over free services.  Firstly, generally better performance
and secondly, a commercial DDNS service has more incentive to continue than
a free service, so your domain name has a long-term security.  We work with
one DDNS provider, tzo.com, to provide dynamic domains under the
<.linkto xitami.net> domain.

<P>A DDNS service works as follows: when you've connected to the Internet,
you need to run some client software that talks to the DDNS server, and
tells it your current IP address.  The DDNS server updates its own DNS
tables and broadcasts update records to other DNS servers on the Internet,
so that your users can eventually use this information to find your server.
For most DDNS services, some client software is available, either as a
Windows program, a Perl script, or a Unix shell script.

<H3>The Xitami Dynamic DDNS Client</H3>

<P>Xitami contains all the code needed to act as a DDNS client for the most
popular DDNS services, including Xitami.Net, tzo.com, dyndns.org, ns1.net,
yi.org, and PengiunPowered.com (surprise, it's intended for Linux owners.
But Xitami lets you use it on any platform).  Furthermore, you can add
support for new DDNS services by editing the file 'ddnsdef.xml', an XML
configuration file. The file contains its own comments. If you add DDNS
services, let us know the details so we can provide them as standard.

<P>As delivered, Xitami supports: localhost, <.linkto xitami.net>,
<.linkto tzo.com>, <linkto yi.org>, <linkto ns1.net>, <.linkto dyndns.org>,
and <.linkto penguinpowered.com>. If you need to, you can define other DDNS
services in the file ddnsdef.xml.  Xitami supports both HTTP and proprietary
DDNS protocols.

<H3>The ddnsdef.xml Definition File</H3>

<P>This file, supplied with Xitami, defines the various DDNS services and
the client protocols needed to register and unregister from them.

<P>The XML structure of this file is:
<PRE>DDNS
  SERVICE
    [SIGNON]
    [SIGNOFF]
</PRE>

<P>The SERVICE item has these attributes:
<UL>
<LI>NAME    (required) - Name of service, used in Xitami config file.
<LI>TITLE   (optional) - Descriptive title, shown in WBA.
<LI>HOST    (optional) - Name of host to connect to (default localhost).
<LI>PORT    (optional) - Port number to connect to (default 80, HTTP port).
<LI>VERBOSE (optional) - If 1, show progress (default 1).
<LI>TRACE   (optional) - If 1, show communications (default 0).
<LI>URL     (optional) - Home-page URL.
</UL>

<P>SIGNON and SIGNOFF have these attributes:
<UL>
<LI>SEND    (required) - String to send to SERVICE.
<LI>EXPECT  (optional) - Expected response from SERVICE ("HTTP/1.? 200*").
</UL>

<P>In the SEND string, you can use these symbols:
<UL>
<LI>$\(username)    - User name or e-mail from Xitami config file.
<LI>$\(password)    - User name or key from Xitami config file.
<LI>$\(domain)      - Dynamic domain name from Xitami config file.
<LI>$\(ipaddr)      - Current local IP address.
<LI>$\(httpauth)    - HTTP 'Authorisation:' header string.
<LI>$\(httpheaders) - Other standard HTTP headers.
<LI>$\(xxxx)        - Any other attribute defined in SIGNON or SIGNOFF.
</UL>

<P>The send and expect strings can contain the escaped characters \\n and
\\r. The expect string is matched against the SERVICE response, if any. The
wildcard character ? matches any character in the response string and the
wildcard character * matches the remainder of the response string.

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>What are Throttle Pipes?</H3>

<P>One problem with web and FTP sites is that they can consume a large
amount of bandwidth.  If your site suddenly becomes popular, it can
disturb other traffic that needs to work on the same line.

<P>For people who use Xitami to do virtual hosting, it's useful to be able
to balance the needs of the different web sites, possibly to provide
different qualities of service to different clients.

<P>Xitami lets you send output (and get input) through named 'throttle
pipes', which you can visualise as pipes with a specific maximum capacity.
For example, a 64Kb pipe will allow 65536 bytes to pass through every
second.

<P>By default, Xitami web sites and FTP sites do not use throttle pipes,
and run at full speed.  You can choose a throttle pipe for a specific web
site (virtual host), and for an FTP service.  You can also specify the
throttle pipe for individual FTP users.  All connections that pass through
the same throttle pipe share its capacity.  So, when you specify the same
throttle pipe for five FTP users, these will share its capacity.  If you
want to give each user the full capacity, you need to define five throttle
pipes.

<H3>Predefined Throttle Pipes</H3>

<P>The predefined throttle pipes are in the file pipedef.xml.  This XML
file specifies each throttle pipe as an 'instance' of a general pipe
definition.  So, for instance, it may define two instances of a 64k pipe.
Each instance is a real, usable throttle pipe.

<H3>Defining New Throttle Pipes</H3>

<P>You can edit the pipedef.xml file directly, but it's a better idea to
copy it, and edit the copy.  Change the server:pipedef option to indicate
the new file name.

<P>When you edit the pipedef file, be sure to read the comments at the
beginning.  These explain the XML syntax that you can use.  The XML file is
case-sensitive.

<P>Xitami defines pipes in terms of bytes per second, not bits per second
(unlike most Internet connections).

<H3>Setting-up a Web Site</H3>

<H4>General Remarks</H4>

<P>Xitami does the same work as any other web server (only faster and more
reliably), so this section covers general information that you can probably
find on the Net, in a hundred books, and in documentation for other web
servers.  Since you chose to look here, we'll feel free to mix our opinions
with our advice.

<P>You must of course have a good idea of 'Why?' before you start building a
web site.  Who is going to access it, how often, and to get what information?
A web site is basically an exercise in publishing.  So be prepared to spend a
lot of time writing and editing material.  Web sites that look like video
games may be fun to build, but are usually painfully slow to work with, and
don't necessarily add any value to the information you're presenting.

<P>There are many tools that help with the process of building and managing
the many HTML files you will need.  However, there is no substitute for a
good knowledge of HTML (which is a <EM>simple</EM> language) and for some
skill in managing complexity.  The shareware HTMLib library is an excellent
reference for the HTML language. (Htmlib is written by Stephen le Hunte: to
find it, search $(*altavista) or any of the other big search engines.)

<P>You may find that a tool like MS FrontPage is ideal for managing this
problem.  You may alternatively prefer a more mechanical solution, such as
the $(*htmlpp) preprocessor that we use for our web site.   Of course, we
recommend htmlpp.  It's simply more open and flexible than any do-it-all
environment like FrontPage.  Whatever choice you make, these are some of the
issues you will have to manage when you start producing dozens, then hundreds
of HTML files:

<UL>
<LI>Organising the files into directories.  Don't go overboard; too many
directories quickly becomes an exercise in futile complexity.
<LI>Keeping a consistent look and feel.  For instance, you may want a
standard header and footer for most files on the site.
<LI>Maintaining links between files.  Nothing makes a worse impact than '404
Not found' messages when people try to navigate a site (except perhaps 'Host
not responding').
<LI>Maintaining links to external sites.  You can use tools to check the
site, and you can use mechanisms to reduce the cost of maintaining such links
(htmlpp does this well).
<LI>Updating the site and managing versions.  You'd be foolish to edit the
files in place, since any mistakes would show-up right away on the site.  A
good approach is to make a full test site (a 'mirror'), with a separate web
server, where you install and test the pages.  Then, you can copy the entire
site across, or individual pages using the date/time settings on each file.
<LI>We like to make HTML sites that can be accessed <EM>without a web
server</EM>.  This can be very useful, with the exception of image maps and
CGI, which need a server to work.  Do not use full URLs ('http://site/file')
when referring to other documents in the site; rather, use <EM>relative
URLs</EM>, which are filenames relative to the actual page.  For instance,
if a document in '/html/tools' needs to reference an image file in
'/html/images/cover.jpg', it can use an URL like this: '../images/cover.jpg'.
If you use full URLs, you'll need a server to access the files.
</UL>

<H4>Top Ten Things To Do</H4>

<OL>
<LI>Learn HTML - use a reference like HTMLib to keep up to date. (Htmlib
is written by Stephen le Hunte: to find it, search $(*altavista) or any of
the other big search engines.)
<LI>Write HTML that works with all browsers, including text-only browsers.
<LI>Learn the basic rule of publishing: <EM>keep it clean</EM>.
<LI>Keep your web pages simple so that they load quickly.
<LI>Your home page should fit on one screen.
<LI>Use an HTML validator tool to check your pages.
<LI>Use a good tool to manage the web site files.
<LI>Keep a test site, and test well before you publish.
<LI>Use the Xitami alias functions to access other resources such as
HTML-driven CD-ROMs.
<LI>Use the Xitami errors.log file to detect and fix link errors.
</OL>

<H4>Things To Avoid Like The Plague</H4>

<OL>
<LI>Blinking text.
<LI>The bells and whistles offered by proprietary extensions - these are
designed to lock you and your clients into vendor-specific solutions.
<LI>Lots of images, unless you are building an intranet site.  Images
can be very useful, but cost a lot in terms of preparation, maintenance,
disk space, and network transport.
<LI>Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PerlScript... unless you are very aware
of the costs and benefits involved.  All programming is expensive, and
executable content is particularly costly. not least because it relies
on untested, rapidly changing technologies.  Like images, executable
content is most often used for flash, not to solve specific problems.
JavaScript, in small quantities, is probably the safest route to go for
small adornments, since most browsers can handle it these days.
<LI>CGI, unless you really need it and are aware of the costs and
benefits involved.  Badly-written CGIs will slow-down your entire site.
Good CGIs can provide a very useful level of interactivity, but you must
know what you are doing.
<LI>Cookies, unless you really know what you're doing.  Sites that use
cookies can be viewed negatively by users.  If you use cookies, make sure
they are set to expire correctly, and do not send a new cookie with each
page.
<LI>All web servers except Xitami - why make your web site run slower? :-)
</OL>

<H3>Installing Xitami</H3>

<P>Xitami is quite simple to set-up -- basically it runs with no
configuration at all -- but your TCP/IP set-up must work first.  You can
start by making a stand-alone site (a browser talking to Xitami on the
same machine), then connect your system to a network and let other
people access your pages.  This is a checklist of things to do:
<UL>
<LI>You need a network adaptor; under Win95, this can be the dial-up
adaptor, rather than a physical card.
<LI>TCP/IP must be installed and ready to use.  You need to be able to
do a 'ping 127.0.0.1' from the DOS command-line.  If this does not work,
you need to correct the network configuration. This can be complex - get
help if necessary.
<LI>Install Xitami and start a browser, then try address
'http://127.0.0.1'. It must show the Xitami home page correctly.
<LI>Try the various links and clickable images.  Only one won't work,
since it links to http://www.imatix.com/.
<LI>To connect your computer to a network, you need to give it a fixed
IP address and a domain name.  This is a job for a network
administrator.  On a dial-up PPP connection you get a temporary IP
address which can be used (eg. http://193.23.54.12/) but it changes each
time you connect.  Some providers will give you a fixed IP address,
sometimes at extra cost.
</UL>

<H3>Getting Yourself Connected</H3>

<P>This section describes how to make your web site available to other
people.  The problems involved in connecting on an internal network are
a little different from connecting to the Internet itself.

<H4>How Do Domain Names Work?</H4>

<P>So long as you have TCP/IP installed and running you can use
127.0.0.1 and 'localhost' (which both mean the same normally)
and which TCP/IP interprets as the 'loopback address', i.e. the
current machine.

<P>When you want to talk to other computers you need to know their IP
address.  Correspondingly your system also needs an IP address.  And
your address has to be unique, network-wide.  When the network is the
Internet, this means world-wide.  There are two ways to get such a
unique address.  One, you ask/pay someone for a fixed address.  Two,
you work with an ISP that owns a pool of addresses.  This is
typically how dial-up PPP connections work: the ISP will lend you an
address for the duration of the connection.

<P>Now, if you dial-up on a PPP line, and you do 'ping xxxx' where
'xxxx' is the name of your system, ping will tell you your current IP
address.  Other people can, then, connect to that address and access
your web pages.  This works.  But they have to type the literal
address: 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'.

<P>TCP/IP uses a system called DNS to translate a name like 'imatix.com'
into an address.  DNS uses a network of servers that are able to
translate names into addresses.  So when you use Netscape to access
imatix.com, your local TCP/IP interface asks its local DNS server to
translate the name.  This goes off, and after several hops comes back
with the address, and then you can connect.

<P>The system name must of course be unique, within the network, or
world-wide on the Internet.  Again, you can get unique names in
several ways.  You can extend an existing domain name
(research.imatix.com) or invent a new domain name (some-thing.com).
Domain names must be registered with the Internic.  This costs $70
for 2 years and $35 per year after that.  You can do this directly or
via your ISP.  It's quite a fast process; the only problem is finding
a good domain name that's not already used.

<P>In general, you'll find that a dial-up PPP connection is not much use
for a web server, since your IP address changes each time you dial-in to
your ISP.  (Ignoring the fact that local phone calls still cost quite a
lot in many parts of the world.)  There are some interesting sites that
help get around this problem by acting as DNS/proxy servers for such
connections.  If you want to do this kind of thing, you'll have to
investigate yourself -- we're getting too deep for a beginner's guide.

<H4>On An Intranet (LAN)</H4>

<P>See your network administrator to get an IP address.  Then,
configure your TCP/IP software so that your computer is reachable from
others on the network.  Generally you'll already have got TCP/IP working
even to run Xitami on a stand-alone system.  What changes with respect
to an intranet is that you need an IP address, and it can't be the same
as any other IP address on the network.

<P>When TCP/IP is working correctly (even before you start Xitami) you
can use the 'ping' command from other machines to check that your
machine is addressable.  Type ping like this:

<PRE>ping <I>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</I></PRE>

<P>Where 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' is the IP address of your machine.  If this
works, then you can start Xitami and access it from a browser using the
URL <TT>http://<I>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</I>/</TT>.

<P>The next step is to get your system known by the DNS (domain name
system).  An intranet usually has one or two domain name servers,
although it's not mandatory.  If DNS is working, you can configure your
TCP/IP to talk to the DNS server - then other PCs will be able to refer
to your system by name, not IP address.

<P>If you do not have a DNS server, you can generally use the 'hosts'
file (in Windows this sites in C:\Windows) to translate IP addresses
into names and vice versa.  Each computer that want to access your web
site needs to put a line in its hosts file.  This is a bit tedious,
which is why DNS exists.

<H4>On The Big Wide World Wide Web</H4>

<P>Getting your site onto the web involves cooperation from a commercial
provider of some sorts.  You can get help from:
<UL>
<LI>Your ISP, who can provide a fixed line or a permanent IP address for
dial-up connections, or space and a connection for your own server PC.
<LI>A virtual host provider, who can provide a complete web site
(although then you are normally not using your own machine).
<LI>A telecoms operator who can provide you with a high-speed link to
one of the Internet backbones.
</UL>

<P>A good solution for a small web site is to pay for a fixed line. There
are various technologies; ISDN, ASDL, POTS (plain old telephone something)
... Check-out the capacity of the line and shop-around for the best deal.
This gives you the most flexibility and control of your system, but may be
limited when handling large volumes. The most interesting type of connection
may be the kind offered by TV cable companies: in some cities this is a very
cheap way to get high-speed IP connections. However, check the rate at which
you can send data out from your server - this is sometimes quite low.

<P>The actual steps involved in setting-up an Internet host are (and
feel free to correct me on this; this is coming from long-unused memory
cells):
<OL>
<LI>Invent a domain name that no-one already uses.  You can telnet to
internic.net (I think) and query their database to see whether your name
of choice has already been used.  You can also use the 'whois' command
to see whether the name is used.
<LI>You have to submit a domain name registration request to the Internic.
<LI>At the same time you have to be able to refer to two DNS servers who
can handle the domain name translation.
<LI>Once the name is registered and the new IP address is given to the
two DNS servers, it gets distributed through the Internet, and after a
few days anyone can access your system either using its IP address or
the domain name.
<LI>It's only really worthwhile doing if you need to aquire a domain
name for business reasons, or you have a permanent connection to the
Net.
</OL>

<P>This is a lot of fuss for normal people, and an ISP can usually do the
whole job for you, though they will charge something extra.

<H4>On a private dial-up network</H4>

<P>You can also become your own ISP by setting-up a pool of modems, and
arranging for dial-up accounts into an internal intranet. This can be very
effective for networks with a specific set of clients - for instance,
salesmen who travel a lot. It can also work in regions where real Internet
connections are expensive or not available. If you want to do this you
should find someone who knows about such things.

<H3>Using Virtual Hosts</H3>

<P>Virtual Hosts are a useful way to manage independent and separate web
sites on a single system, with one copy of Xitami running on the main HTTP
port 80. The user sees separate web sites - you need only manage one server.
This is of most use when you want to host several sites but only manage a
single web server. You can also run one copy of Xitami per site. Since
Xitami is small and does not use much memory both approaches are practical.

<P>The $(*vhosts=virtual_hosts_section) gives a detailed explanation of what
virtual hosts are and how to set them up. We'll cover some more introductory
topics here.

<P>When you define virtual hosts, each virtual host can have its own
webpages directory, CGI directory, log files, error messages, password file,
timeouts, etc. In fact, almost all Xitami options except those that affect
the whole server (such as the port) can be specific to the virtual host.

<P>To define a virtual host you define a specific config file - this
contains all the options that are specific to that virtual host; other
options are then inherited from the xitami.cfg and defaults.cfg files.

<P>To create virtual hosts, you must be able to define new entries in the
domain name system (DNS) or be able to define multiple IP addresses on your
system. Neither of these are jobs for beginners, so if you've not done it
before, get competent advice.

<H3>Managing Your Web Site</H3>

<H4>Updating The Site</H4>

<P>It's a good idea to work with a 'test site'. This is simply a directory
on your PC where you install and test the HTML files, images, CGI scripts,
and other resources before you install them on your public web site. For
instance, the iMatix site is built on its own disk partition, where each
directory matches that on our web site.

<P>We do not generally work directly on the files in the test site. Rather,
we build a package of HTML files, images, whatever, then install them into
the test site. This lets different people manage different sections of the
site. It's also a natural way to work when one uses tools like htmlpp.

<P>There are basically two ways to update a web site: the 'dribble' and the
'stomp'. Dribbling means updating it in small pieces; a few files here and
there. This is typically how people work when they don't use a test site.
Stomping means shoving several tons of stuff onto the site at once, so that
everything is updated together. Dribble works for spot updates, bug fixes,
and such. But it is not a good way to work in the long term: stomping is
safer and not much slower.

<P>We stomp our site using a couple of Perl scripts that find all files
changed since the last stomp; these files are compressed into a zip file,
which is sent by file transfer to the web site. There we decompress it. It's
a lot faster to do this than to transfer the individual files one by one
(firstly, zip files are compressed by about 75% unless you are already
handling compressed data, and secondly, it takes a second or two to
negotiate a file transfer, which is slow when you transfer dozens of small
files).

<P>There are of course many free and shareware tools (such as Netload)
available to do this kind of thing, but none that we know of will use a
zip-style compression to save upload time.

<H4>Counting Hits</H4>

<P>Xitami produces standard NCSA-style log files that can be read and
analysed by most log file analysers. People often misuse the term 'hits' to
imply that one hit is one person visting the site. This is not true. For
instance, the iMatix web site has 250,000 hits in a typical month, but about
15,000 actual visitors, or whom perhaps 2,500 stay long enough on the main
page to trigger the page counter. Each page has several images as well as
the HTML text, and people will read several pages.

<P>To accurately count the number of visitors to your site, you can count
the number of hits to the main page. If you encourage people to always visit
your site's main page (publish just that URL), then your statistics will be
more accurate.

.page Writing Web Server Extension (WSX) Agents

.build anchor wsx
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>What is WSX?</H3>

<P>WSX is the Xitami equivalent of protocols like ASAPI, ISAPI, etc.  A WSX
program is always written as a multithreaded SMT agent, and is linked into
the server executable.  Unlike the xxAPI protocols, WSX agents are not
loaded at runtime from dynamic link libraries, but are bound into the Xitami
executable.  This is done mainly to keep things simple, but also because SMT
does not support dynamically-loaded agents.

<P>A WSX agent handles some specific type of URL, based on the name of the
URL. For example, Xitami comes with two standard WSX agents - xiadmin and
xierror - which handle URLs starting with "/admin" and "/error"
respectively.

<P>Writing WSX agents is not trivial, but it's worth it for certain kinds of
work.  If you want to write WSX agents, you should take a good look at the
SMT documentation, and study the standard WSX agents.  WSX is <EM>not</EM> a
'fast CGI' protocol.  A WSX agent is tightly-bound into the web server,
while a CGI program is most definitely not.  I'll summarise the differences
between a CGI program and a WSX agent:
<UL>
<LI>CGI programs are portable between web servers; WSX agents are a specific
Xitami plug-in.
<LI>If a CGI program crashes, the user gets a nice error message.  If a WSX
agent crashes, the server is probably dead.
<LI>CGI programs are single-threaded: each on-going request is handled by
a separate CGI process; a WSX agent can handle multiple requests at once,
in the same way as Xitami handles multiple connections at once.
<LI>CGI programs are usually written by people with functional knowledge
(by this, I mean they are developing some kind of business solution),
whereas a WSX agent is a highly technical solution.
<LI>WSX agents can be used to extend the web server's functionality in
entirely new directions.  For instance, you could implement protocols like
FastCGI using a WSX agent.  CGI cannot be used in this manner.
<LI>WSX agents must be written using the SMT toolkit (including ANSI C and
the Libero tool), while CGI programs can be written in a variety of
languages (C, Perl, server-side Java, Basic, Awk).
<LI>You can do things with CGIs (like accessing slow databases) that are not
acceptable in WSX agents.
</UL>

<P>A WSX agent talks to the web server (actually, the smthttp agent) using a
set of messages. When a user asks for a URL that matches WSX agent, smthttp
sends the agent a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message. The WSX agent processes
the request (which can be a HTTP GET or POST), and replies with a WSX_OK,
WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_BIN, WSX_MBIN, WSX_ERROR, WSX_REDIRECT, WSX_RESTART, or
WSX_KILL message.

<P>The WSX agent gets a bunch of things from the web server: the URL that
was asked for, any arguments, the current HTTP symbol table, and the posted
data, if any. In return, it provides either the HTML data to show (for
WSX_OK, WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_BIN, or WSX_MBIN), a HTTP error code (for
WSX_ERROR), a redirected URL (for WSX_REDIRECT), or nothing (for the other
messages).

<H3>Writing WSX Programs</H3>

<H4>Single-threaded or Multithreaded?</H4>

<P>Like all SMT agents, a WSX agent is either single-threaded or
multithreaded. A single-threaded agent is simpler to write than a
multithreaded agent, but is more limited in what it can do. The two WSX
agents provided with Xitami are both single-threaded.  More complex WSX
agents, such as the xilrwp agent, are multithreaded.

<P>The main difference is this: a single-threaded agent can only handle one
request at a time.  A multithreaded agent can handle dozens or hundreds.
If the agent can answer a request with little work, a single-thread can
be sufficient.  If a request implies some 'slow' work, such as making a
connection to another process or computer, or sending some message to another
agent and waiting for a reply, a multithreaded agent is better.

<P>In terms of programming, a single-threaded agent needs to use some
specific SMT notation (such as setting the SINGLE_THREADED macro to TRUE)
and does not handle any thread context.  A multithreaded agent in contrast
works with a thread context block that contains all data for the thread.
You'll find details of this in the SMT documentation, as well as examples of
both types of agent in the SMT source code.  For example, smthttp itself is
a multithreaded agent, while smtsock is single-threaded.

<H4>Managing Session Context</H4>

<P>There are two broad classes of WSX agent: those which have to handle
session context, and those that do not.  Examples of agents that require
session context are:
<UL>
<LI>The xiadmin administration agent; it has to know which screen the user
was working in, and what they were doing.
<LI>An agent that implements some kind of multi-transaction form; i.e. a
form where the user can make changes and work with more than one exchange
step.
</UL>

<P>Examples of agents that do not require session context are:
<UL>
<LI>The xierror error simulation agent; each request is totally independent
of any previous request.
<LI>An agent that implements CGI or a similar stateless protocol.
<LI>An agent that satisfies any other kind of stateless request.
</UL>

<P>HTTP is often described as a 'stateless protocol', but there are in fact
several ways to implement state. We can define state as a set of variables
that the server (or the WSX agent) needs to distinguish one user from
another, and to tell what state the user was in. I generally call this the
'context' for a session. Context is necessary if you want a decent level of
security, complexity, and ease of use. One commonly-used way to implement
context is <EM>cookies</EM>. These have a bad press: cookies are too often
abused to keep track of users' activity on a website. Another method is to
encode the context in the URLs used in the form. For instance, each submit
button or URL will invoke the same URL, but with an argument (?xxx) that
contains the context data. This has several disadvantages: sensitive
information that should be kept internally on the server may be sent to the
browser; the HTML stream can become very large; and the arguments sent back
to the server can also become very large. It has an advantages too: there is
no need to save any kind of data in the server.

<P>My preferred technique is to save the context in allocated memory, and
then to encode a <EM>key</EM> in the URL, using the ?xxx technique.  When
the WSX agent receives the request, it checks whether the key is present and
valid, and if so, continues the session with that data.  If not, it can
choose to show an error screen or reinitialise the session.  The HTML stream
is not affected by the size of the context, since all that is transmitted is
the session context key.

<P>If you encode session in this way, you need to do a few things if you are
building a serious server:
<UL>
<LI>You have to ensure that the session context key is unique, of course.
<LI>You must either generate a new key for each session step, or add some
kind of step counter, to enable the server to tell if the user uses the
browser's Back action, and then tries to resubmit the form data.
<LI>You must clean-up contexts when the user ends a session (if it is
possible to determine this) or when the session has been inactive for a
certain time (which you can determine using SMTTIME alarm messages).
<LI>You may want to compress the context (there are functions in SFL to do
this kind of thing).
</UL>

<P>One troublesome problem is the browser Back action.  There is no way to
disable this, and HTTP/1.1 specifically states that there is no way to
change the behaviour of a browser's history (which is what this is).  The
problem arises because when a user uses the Back action, they can resubmit a
form that is no longer meaningful in the current context.  One solution that
we have used in this situation is to refresh the current form when we detect
that the user has a valid session key but an invalid 'step' (i.e. has used
the Back action).  Another solution is to simply redisplay the main form
when this happens.  In any case, it's worth educating the user -- if only
with a small message on the main form -- that the Back action is not a good
idea within these forms.

<H4>Messages From smthttp</H4>

<P>A WSX agent talks to smthttp. The protocol is strictly binary: smthttp
sends a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message to the agent; the agent processes
this and sends back a reply. Each request has exactly one reply.

<P>The smtmsg.h and smtmsg.c modules provide functions to send and decode
WSX messages (as well as all the other SMT messages). These macros are used
to send a message to a WSX agent. Normally only smthttp does this, but you
may want to chain WSX agents so that one sends messages to another:
<PRE>send_wsx_request (
    QID  *to,                       /*  Destination thread queue       */
    char *request_url,              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments,                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host,             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    char *filename,                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    char *post_data,                /*  POSTed data, if any            */
    word  symbols_size,             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data,             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size,              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data);             /*  HTTP config table data         */
);

send_wsx_reqbin (
    QID  *to,                       /*  Destination thread queue       */
    char *request_url,              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments,                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host,             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    word  post_size,                /*  POSTed data size               */
    char *filename,                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    byte *post_data,                /*  POSTed data                    */
    word  symbols_size,             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data,             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size,              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data);             /*  HTTP config table data         */
);
</PRE>

<P>The request URL is an alias used to indicate what URLs the WSX
processes.  You can use '/' to indicate all URLs for a website or virtual
host.

<P>The HTTP symbol table is prepared as for a CGI process. That is, it
contains the same CGI fields, and the HTTP header fields under the same
conditions. Symbol names are converted to uppercase, with hyphens replaced
by underlines. For instance, the 'Content-Type:' header value is held as a
symbol called 'CONTENT_TYPE'. This block is stored as a table of strings of
the format "name=value" and a single null. The table ends with a null string
(two nulls in a row). To convert this block back into a usable symbol table
you can use the SFL descr2symb() function (from sflsymb.c). To use this you
must first prepare a DESCR block (which holds the size and data in a single
structure) as follows:
<PRE>DESCR symbols;
SYMTAB *symtab;

symbols.size = request-> symbols_size;
symbols.data = request-> symbols_data;
symtab = descr2symb (&symbols);
</PRE>
See below for an explanation of how to get the 'request' structure used in
this example.

<P>The virtual_host field is NULL if the request was made to the default
host; if the request was made to a virtual host, this field contains the
name or ip address of the virtual host as defined in the main config file
under the [Virtual-Host] section.

<P>The post_data field contains the POSTed HTTP data, if any.  In some cases
this data may be placed in a temporary file; in this case the post_data
field contains '@<I>filename</I>'.  The WSX agent should read the data from
this file.  It does not need to delete the file: this is done by Xitami
automatically.

<P>This is the structure of a WSX request:
<PRE>typedef struct {
    char *request_url;              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments;                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host;             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    char *filename;                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    char *post_data;                /*  POSTed data, if any            */
    word  symbols_size;             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data;             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size;              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data;              /*  HTTP config table data         */
} struct_smt_wsx_request;

typedef struct_smt_wsx_request WSXREQ;
</PRE>

<P>To unpack a WSX_REQUEST message into this structure, use this function:
<PRE>int get_smt_wsx_request (byte *buffer, struct_smt_wsx_request *request);
</PRE>

<P>For example:
<PRE>struct_smt_wsx_request
    *request = NULL;               /*  Incoming smt_wsx request       */

/*  Decode the WSX request using this standard function call          */
get_smt_wsx_request (thread-> event-> body, &request);

if (request)
    the_next_event = ok_event;
else
  {
    /*  The request can only be null if there is no memory left       */
    send_wsx_error (&thread-> event-> sender, HTTP_RESPONSE_OVERLOADED);
    the_next_event = exception_event;
  }
</PRE>

<P>When you've finished with a request, you must deallocate it as follows:
<PRE>/*  We're finished with the request structure - deallocate it         */
free_smt_wsx_request (&request);
</PRE>

<P>This is the structure of a WSX binary request:
<PRE>typedef struct {
    char *request_url;              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments;                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host;             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    word  post_size;                /*  POSTed data size               */
    char *filename;                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    byte *post_data;                /*  POSTed data                    */
    word  symbols_size;             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data;             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size;              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data;              /*  HTTP config table data         */
} struct_smt_wsx_request;
</PRE>

<P>To unpack a WSX_REQBIN message into this structure, use this function:
<PRE>int get_smt_wsx_reqbin (byte *buffer, struct_smt_wsx_request *request);
</PRE>

<H4>Messages Back To smthttp</H4>

<P>The WSX agent can reply to a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN with one of these
messages:
<UL>
<LI>WSX_OK - send a HTTP reply to the user (HTTP code 200).  This can be
HTML text, or the name of a file containing binary data.
<LI>WSX_MULTIPART - send a HTTP reply to the user, as for WSX_OK, but
continue waiting for WSX messages from the WSX agent.  This allows a WSX
agent to send multipart messages to the web browser.  The last message, if
any, should be a WSX_OK.
<LI>WSX_BIN - send a HTTP reply to the user, as for WSX_OK, but where the
body contains arbitrary binary data, e.g. an image file.
<LI>WSX_MBIN - As WSX_MULTIPART, for binary data.
<LI>WSX_ERROR - return error status to the user (HTTP codes 3xx, 4xx, or
5xx).  The user will get the error message as formatted by the web server
according to the configuration profile.
<LI>WSX_REDIRECT - redirect the request to another URL.  This is returned to
the browser as a code 302.
<LI>WSX_RESTART - show a page of HTML to the user (HTTP code 200), then
restart the web server.  All open connections (HTTP and FTP) are killed by
this action.
<LI>WSX_KILL - show a page of HTML to the user (HTTP code 200), then
terminate the web server.  All open connections (HTTP and FTP) are killed by
this action.
</UL>

<P>The following macros prepare and send reply messages:
<PRE>send_wsx_ok        (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_multipart (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_bin       (QID *to, qbyte html_size, byte *html_data);
send_wsx_mbin      (QID *to, qbyte html_size, byte *html_data);
send_wsx_error     (QID *to, dbyte error_code);
send_wsx_redirect  (QID *to, char *new_url);
send_wsx_restart   (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_kill      (QID *to, char *html_data);
</PRE>

<P>Note that the 'to' argument in these calls is the queue id of the smthttp
agent, which sent the original WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message.

<P>The code for unpacking these messages (if you're calling a WSX agent) is
similar to that described above for WSX_REQUEST and WSX_REQBIN. You can see
the details in smtmsg.h.

<P>The WSX_OK, WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_RESTART, and WSX_KILL messages send
'html_data' to the web server. This data should respect the rules for CGI
output. Normally it would be a HTML page, e.g.:
<PRE>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hello World!
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

<P>You can also start the data with your own HTTP header fields if necessary,
using the traditional blank line to separate the header from the body, e.g.:
<PRE>Cache-control: no-cache

&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hello World!
&lt;/HTML&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>

<P>This argument must be a string, so to transfer binary data, Xitami also
understands the syntax '@filename', where <I>filename</I> refers to a
<EM>temporary</EM> file that Xitami will parse, send, then delete.  The file
should start with a 'Content-Type: some/type' header, followed by a blank
line, and the file data.  A WSX_BIN or WSX_MBIN message is probably more
efficient for transferring binary data, unless you already have a temporary
file sitting around.

<P>The WSX_BIN and WSX_MBIN messages send a binary block of data back to the
web server. This should be formatted with a Content-Type: header, a blank
line, and the binary data as follows:
<PRE>Content-Type: xxxx/yyyy

..binary data..
</PRE>

<H4>Starting From A Skeleton Program</H4>

<P>If you start writing a new WSX program, start from a skeleton. The
xierror program is a simple example of a single-threaded, context-free WSX
agent. This is pretty much the simplest example you can make. You should
start by copying xierror.l and xierror.c to new files (keep these
extensions).

<P>Like any SMT agent, you start the design phase in the dialog (.l file).
Look at the dialog file, either using a text editor, or using the Libero
tool (which is amply documented in the Libero documentation from the iMatix
web site).  You'll need to install Libero to make any changes to the agent.

<H4>Modifying The Server main() Function</H4>

<P>Before you can test a WSX agent you must install it into the server
main() function.  This is how the xierror agent is defined in the Xitami
program (xitami.c).  First, we define a prototype near the start of the
program:
<PRE>int xierror_init (void);         /*  Xitami error simulation agent    */
</PRE>

<P>Then we initialise the xierror agent before starting the main HTTP agent.
Here is the code which initialises all the WSX agents, then the main smthttp
agent:
<PRE>xiadmin_init ();                 /*  Xitami administration agent      */
xierror_init ();                 /*  Xitami error simulation agent    */
smthttp_init (rootdir, cgidir);
</PRE>

<P>The order of these initialisation functions can be important.  For
example, if you want to install dynamic WSX aliases (see below) when your
agent initialises, you must add the xxxx_init() call <I>after</I> the call
to smthttp_init().  This provides smthttp the opportunity to create its
main thread.

<P>The Windows 95 and Windows NT source code is available for individual
developers and companies at various prices - contact us for details. You can
purchase this if you want to make OEM versions of the Windows servers.
The OS/2, UNIX, and OpenVMS source code is supplied with the Xitami source
package.

<H4>Modifying The Server Config Files</H4>

<P>To install a 'static' WSX agent you have to change the config files for
the server; add an entry to the [WSX] section like this:
<PRE>[WSX]
path=agent
</PRE>
Where 'path' is a single word that identifies all URLs passed to this WSX
agent, and 'agent' is the agent name (as defined internally in the agent).
You can define a different path per virtual host, or organise your site so
that specific WSX agents are only available on specific virtual hosts.

<P>It is also possible to add and remove paths at runtime.  There are two
macros that do this:
<PRE>send_wsx_install (QID *to, char *vhost, char *path, char *agent);
send_wsx_cancel  (QID *to, char *vhost, char *path);
</PRE>

<P>Note that the 'to' argument in these calls is the queue id of the smthttp
agent. You should use the following style of code to identify this queue id:
<PRE>THREAD *http_thread;

/*  Find 'main' thread in smthttp agent             */
http_thread = thread_lookup (SMT_HTTP, "main");
ASSERT (http_thread);
send_wsx_install (&http_thread-> queue-> qid, NULL, pattern, AGENT_NAME);
</PRE>

<P>The vhost argument tells the smthttp agent what virtual hosts the WSX
agent should be accessible to. If this argument is NULL, the agent will be
accessible to all virtual hosts. If the argument is a virtual host name or
ip address as defined in the [Virtual-Hosts] section of the config file, the
agent will be invisible to other virtual hosts. Note that you can send
several WSX_INSTALL messages, for different virtual hosts, if required.

<H4>Testing And Debugging The WSX Agent</H4>

<P>The best way to test and debug a WSX agent (as for any SMT program) is to
use the Libero animator.  This is a simple code-generation option (-anim)
which causes the agent to display every step it goes through to handle the
request.  Animation output is sent to the console or to one of the log
files, depending on the way you set-up the server.

<P>Since the effects of a bug in a WSX agent will show-up as browser error
messages, or other funny reactions, you can also set the server:debug option
on.  This causes all headers to be logged - a useful way of seeing what is
actually being sent back to the browser.

<H4>Writing Efficient WSX Agents</H4>

<P>The basic rules of multithreaded SMT programming apply.  Your program
should not block.  For example, it'd be a bad idea to try to access a
relational database and execute some SQL code.  The entire web server would
block while the SQL request was being satisfied.

<P>If you need to do database access, there are other, more efficient ways
to do this.  The best way we know is to work with more than one process; the
web server passes requests (transactions) to a second process that handles
them one by one.  You can scale this model up to very large systems handling
tens of transactions per second.  This is the type of approach that is well-
implemented using a WSX agent.

.page Extending Xitami with External Peer Processes

.build anchor lrwp
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>By Robin Dunn <robind@earthling.net>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Any serious web-based application relies, possibly quite heavily, on
dynamic content. In other words, dynamically generated pages.

<H4>CGI</H4>

<P>To facilitate the need for dynamic content, CGI was invented back in the
dark-ages of the Web (just a few years ago.) While CGI provides the ability
to do dynamic generation of web pages as well as quite an elegant and
flexible interface, it also has a very big wart. It is <B>too slow</B> for
serious work. The basic model that CGI follows is:
<OL>
<LI>The web server receives a request that maps to a CGI handler.
<LI>The web server starts a new process with the specified CGI command,
feeding the CGI data to it.
<LI>The web server waits for the process to terminate.
<LI>The output of the process is sent to the browser.
</OL>

<P>Unfortunately, each time the CGI process is started, it can be several
seconds before it is able to even begin processing the request. Depending on
the OS there may be a large amount of overhead in creating a new process.
There may be a Perl or other language interpreter to load and initialize,
followed by loading and parsing the CGI script itself. Database connections
may have to be made, files opened, etc.

<H4>Server Extensions</H4>

<P>Because of the shortcomings of CGI, server extension APIs were created by
the various web server vendors.  For example, Netscape provides NSAPI,
Microsoft ISAPI, Apache ASAPI, and even Xitami has WSX. (Isn't it refreshing
to <B>not</B> have &quot;SAPI&quot; at the end?)

<P>While these extension APIs do away with the overhead of process creation
they introduce a few warts of their own:
<OL>
<LI>The extension is linked into the server itself, (either statically at
compile/link time or dynamically at runtime) so bugs in the extension can
potentially bring down the entire web-server.
<LI>Server extensions by their nature are highly specific to the API it is
written for. It would be very difficult to be portable to another
server.
<LI>You are limited in your choice of languages to what is supported by
the API.
</OL>

<H4>Persistent CGI</H4>

<P>There have been several alternatives that combine the ease of use and
flexibility of CGI with the efficiency of Server extension APIs.  One of the
most popular of these is called <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI</A>
developed by <A HREF="http://www.openmarket.com/">Open Market, Inc.</A>
FastCGI or other persistent CGI alternatives are, as the name suggests, a CGI
type of interface that is Faster than CGI.  It could potentially be up to 20
times faster, or more, depending on what kind of startup/initialization
overhead the script has.  It does this phenomenal feat by allowing the CGI
process to handle more than a single request each time it starts up.  The web
server communicates with the running persistent CGI process via a socket and
sends the appropriate data to the persistent CGI process when the reqest is
made.  The persistent CGI process does its thing, generates an html page or
other response and sends it back over the socket and then instead of
terminating, it waits for the next request.

<H3>LRWP</H3>
<P>Begining with version 2.2a, Xitami includes a persistent CGI extension
called LRWP, (which stands for Long Running Web Process.)  LRWP is written as
a WSX agent which implements a simple protocol for communicating with external
processes called Peers.  The peer process simply waits for the requests to
come from Xitami and then responds with a valid http response, just like a
CGI program.  The main difference is that like other persistent CGI
solutions, the LRWP peer waits around for another HTTP request instead of
terminating.

<P>LRWP is not FastCGI, but it is very similar.  The protocol between Xitami
and the LRWP Peer is much simpler than the FastCGI protocol, and therefore
less prone to implementation differences or errors.  However, given the right
circumstances it is possible to run the same program as both a LRWP Peer and
a FastCGI Peer with only minor differences in the startup code.

<H3>The LRWP protocol</H3>

<P>As mentioned above, the communications protocol between the LRWP Peer and
the LRWP Agent within Xitami is quite simple.

<OL>
<LI>The Peer connects to the port specified in the [LRWP] section of the
Xitami configuration file, (offset by portbase if needed,) and sends a
startup string.  The startup string has three components:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>The appname or alias.  This is what will be used to redirect HTTP
requests to the Peer.  For example, if you use "testapp" as the
alias, then requests begining with http://yourhostname.com/testapp
will be sent to the peer.  If the alias is "this/is/a/test" then
requets begining with http://yourhostname.com/this/is/a/test will be
sent.
<P>If multiple peers connect with the same alias name, then multiple
simultaneous requests will be able to be handled.  If there are more
simultaneous requests then there are peers to handle them, then the
LRWP Agent in Xitami will queue up the requests and wait for a peer
to complete its current request.
<LI>The next component of the startup string is the name of the
virtual host to be associated with.  If a name is passed, then the
peer will only be given requests that are directed to that virtual
host.  Otherwise, the peer will be sent requests from any virtual or
nonvirtual host that matches the alias.
<LI>The third component of the startup string is reserved for a
currently unimplemented feature.
</OL>

<P>Each component of the startup string is separated by a character with
an ASCII value of 255.
<LI>The LRWP Agent then responds with either "OK" or an error message
that begins with "ERROR".  If "OK" then the peer is good to go,
otherwise the LRWP Agent is rejecting the connection for some reason and
you have some debugging to do.
<LI>At this point the Peer simply waits for a request to be sent to
it.  When the request comes, it is formatted as follows:

<CENTER>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1>
<TR>
<TD> ENV size </TD>
<TD> ENV data as a series of name=value pairs </TD>
<TD> POST size </TD>
<TD> POST data, if any </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>A nine-digit, zero-filled number representing the size of the
CGI-environment data.  For example, "000001234".
<LI>Immediately following the size is that number of bytes of
data formatted as NAME=VALUE pairs, each separated by a NULL byte.
<LI>The next component is another nine-digit, zero-filled number,
this time representing the size of the POST data, if any.
<LI>If there is any POST data, the specifed number of bytes comes
next.
</OL>

<LI>The Peer now has everything it needs to handle the request, so at
this point it should do whatever it needs to create a HTML document, or
some other type of data to return.  The Peer then sends back on the
socket the number of bytes it will be sending, formatted as a nine-digit,
zero-filled number, followed by that number of bytes of data.

<P>The content returned to the server will be treated just like the
output from CGI programs, so content-type and other headers are
significant.

<LI>At this point the Peer should either exit or go back to wait for
another request.  If it exits, and if there are no other peers attached
to the server with the same alias name, then that URI will
fall-back to default Xitami handling.  For example, if the URI
doesn't match a real file or directory then it returns an access
error, otherwise the physical file or directory will be processed
normally.

<P>There may be situations where this is a highly desirable feature, for
example if you are running a contest and only want to collect 100
entries, the peer could exit after collecting the desired amount and
then Xitami will fall-back to a static document at the same URI that
explains that the contest is now closed.

<P>Another reason to exit is to ensure that any memory leaks in your
program or the interpreter it is built upon are released.  In order for
this to be effective you probably will want to have the ability to
automatically restart your peer processes.  (UPM is currently being
modified to allow this type of functionality.)  For example, I know
people with scripts running in the FastCGI environment that only allow
the processes to handle 50 requests and then they exit and get restarted
by an external process monitor.
</OL>

<H3>LRWP Environment Variables</H3>
<P>LRWP programs receive the same environment variables as a CGI program.
If you're in doubt as to which ones these are, either read this manual again
or run the testcgi program supplied with Xitami.

<H3>The LRWP Library</H3>
<P>Included with Xitami is a small library of C functions to assist
in writing LRWP Peers.  The source files are lrwplib.h and lrwplib.c and
contain the following functions:


<p><hr WIDTH="60%" ALIGN=Center><pre>
char* lrwp_connect(LRWP* lrwp,        /* pointer to UNCONNECTED LRWP object */
                   char* appname,     /* Name or alias of Peer app         */

<H3>Installing and Configuring Xitami</H3>

.FAQH i When I try to use the /admin setup, Xitami asks for a password!
<P>Create two files:
<OL>
<LI>defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut
</PRE>
<LI>defaults.aut:
<PRE>[/Admin]
    admin=verysecret
</PRE>
</OL>
Now use userid 'admin' and password 'verysecret' to access the WBA.

.FAQ i Help - I don't understand how to define users and passwords!
<P>Xitami uses two separate user/password systems, one for web pages and
one for FTP access.  To start with, create the defaults.cfg and defaults.aut
file as described above.  Then, for each webpage directory you want to
protect, add an entry in defaults.aut.  Enter the URL directory with or
without a leading '/' - it does not matter.  Add each user with their
password.  For instance, to say that only 'John' and 'Janet' can get at
webpages starting with '/personal', you write something this:
<PRE>
[/personal]
    john=Go96xas883
    janet=Yhs7gsr73
</PRE>
(I'm inventing silly passwords here.)
<P>For FTP access, you need to define each FTP user separately.  First, add
these lines to defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Ftp]
    Directory-file=ftpdloc.aut
    User-file=ftplocal.aut
</PRE>
Now you can edit ftplocal.aut to define users.  The file ftpusers.aut shows
what's allowed.  For example, to define an 'anonymous' user, who connects to
the ftproot/pub directory with read access only, write this in ftplocal.aut:
<PRE>[Anonymous]
    Access=G
    Password=*
    Root=/pub
</PRE>
<P>A fairly classic setup is to define a personal web space for each user
which they can update using FTP.  Be careful with this, since it's possible
to set things up so that any user can run a CGI program (unsafe on Windows
systems).  However, this is how you do it:
<OL>
<LI>For each user, create a directory below the ftproot with the user's
short name.
<LI>Create an FTP account as described above.  Use the access rights GPD,
and MR if you want allow them to create/remove directories.
<LI>Define an HTTP alias that points to this directory.  For instance, in
defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Alias]
    john=ftproot/john
</PRE>
<LI>If you also want these webpages to be private (password protected), add
an entry to defaults.aut:
<PRE>[/John]
    john=Gsh65sgs12
</PRE>
</OL>

.FAQ i Can I refer to an environment variable in the webpages setting?
<P>Yes.  For example, if you defined the variable WEBROOT to specify the
webpages location, use $\(WEBROOT) in the webpages setting.  Note that
environment variables are set in your startup script at the operating
system level (e.g. .profile under Unix, autoexec.bat under Windows 95).

.build anchor reset-default
.FAQ i I've screwed-up my installation and nothing works - Help!
<P>If you edited xitami.cfg, you have to get the original version back out
of the Xitami zip file or installation package.  Under Windows you can use
Winzip or unzip to extract files from the .exe packages.  If you only worked
through the WBA, you can delete defaults.cfg.  See the previous question for
defining a new admin user and password.

.FAQ i I installed Xitami two days ago, and now I can't connect to it!
<P>You probably set the server IP address to something.  Delete the line
ipaddress=xxx in the defaults.cfg file.  If you really grok it, delete
defaults.cfg.  See the previous question.

.FAQ i What is a 'HTTP port', actually?
<P>It is a TCP/IP port that is used for HTTP. (HTTP being the HyperText
Transfer Protocol, the means by which web pages, etc, get transfered around
(usually).)

.FAQ i Why do web servers want to use port 80 by default?
<P>In order to contact a program running on another computer via TCP/IP
(such as, say, a web server), you need to know two things: the IP address of
the other computer, and the TCP/IP port on which it is listening for
requests. The URL always includes the name of the other system (or its IP
address), from which you can get the IP address that you need. The TCP/IP
port </I>can</I>be included in the URL, but usually isn't. So you need
another way to find out the URL. Of the various ways that this could be done
(ask someone/another computer, guess, etc), the one chosen for most TCP/IP
services is "you just know what it is". That is, there is a "Well Known"
port number for most TCP/IP services including HTTP, which "everyone knows",
and if nothing else is specified then that is the one that is used. The
"Well Known" port number for HTTP is 80. So the servers want to use it by
default so that everyone will know where to find them by default.

.FAQ i Is there some way to disable the WBA completely?
<P>Yes, set the security:admin option to 0.

.FAQ How do I know that my personal config 'xxx.cfg' is being loaded?
<P>Edit the config file and add a line '! Loading xxx.cfg'. Now, enable
server debugging, and when you start Xitami, this message is output to the
debug.log file.

.FAQ i Why does the installation replace my xitami.cfg and .aut files?
<P>It has to do this, since new versions of Xitami may depend on updated
\.cfg and \.aut files. The important thing is to make all changes in
defaults.cfg, and this includes defining your own .aut file, so that the two
standard files can be reinstalled at any time.
<P>The installation will not override other files, except those provided as
standard in the install package (e.g. default.htm).  So, as a general rule,
do not modify anything that was supplied as standard, and if you're really
paranoid, make a backup before you re-install Xitami.

.FAQ i How do I install a new version of Xitami without losing my config?
<P>Firstly, make sure you did not change either xitami.cfg or xitami.aut.
If you did change these, put your changes into defaults.cfg and
defaults.aut, and add this to defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut
</PRE>
In principle you can now re-install Xitami safely.  The installation will
not overwrite anything else you modified, including log files, web pages,
CGIs, etc.  However, for safety, make a zip of the whole Xitami root before
re-installing, just in case.  You should do this regularly anyhow.

.FAQ i Can I install Xitami on a system that already has a web server?
<P>If you are already running a server on port 80, you must configure Xitami
to run on some other port.  Change or create defaults.cfg:
<PRE>[server]
    portbase=1000
</PRE>
will run Xitami on port 1080.  The portbase is also added to the standard
FTP port of 21 to give, in this case, 1021.

.FAQ i How do I change the HTTP port but leave the FTP port at 21?
<P>You can shift the HTTP port between 80 and 100 while leaving the FTP port
at 21.  Set the server portbase to a value between 1 and 20, and subtract
this from the FTP port setting.  So, to move the HTTP port to 90, set the
portbase to 10, and the FTP port to 11.

.FAQ i When I'm not connected to the network, Xitami is VERY slow!
<P>Under Windows 95 and NT, your network configuration must match what's
really going on. For instance, if your TCP/IP configuration specifies a
particular gateway or DHCP server that is not available (because you are not
physically connected). Check that the host and domain info in the DNS tab of
the TCP/IP properties in the network control panel matches the info in the
identification tab of the network control panel.
<P> One typical symptom is that when you click on the Xitami icon in the
taskbar, it takes a minute or two before the Xitami window appears. You may
also get error messages when trying to point your browser to 127.0.0.1. The
bottom line is this: if you want to run your PC off-line from the network,
you must ensure that your PC's network configuration matches. There are
various shareware tools that help you to manage multiple network
configurations, for example NetSwitcher.

.FAQ i 'ping 127.0.0.1' works but I can't connect to http://127.0.0.1/
<P>There are many possible causes of this problem.  The ones we know:
<OL>
<LI>The browser simply won't connect at all... you probably told Xitami to
use a specific IP address, which excludes accesses via 127.0.0.1. Solution:
delete any line 'ipaddress=xxx' in defaults.cfg.
<LI>If you're using a proxy server, first try to disable this completely.
If this improves things, now reconfigure the proxy settings so that the
local addresses (127.0.0.1 and localhost) get past.  If this still fails,
you may need to define an entry in your 'hosts' file for 'localhost'.
<LI>Your server may be behind a proxy server that is not allowing HTTP
connections to get past.  See your network administrator.
</OL>

.FAQ i I can connect to http://127.0.0.1/ but not http://127.0.0.1/admin
<P>There are many possible causes of this problem.  The ones we know:
<OL>
<LI>You may have an old version of Xitami. Make sure you're running at least
version 2.0.
<LI>You may have installed a new version of Xitami but kept the xitami.cfg
from an old installation. This can leave the WSX definition for /admin
undefined, so /admin will not work. Symptom: you get 'not supported' as an
error message.
<LI>If you're using Xitami under Windows 3.x, the /admin WBA is not
supported.  The 32-bit 'console' version of Xitami can run under Win32s.
</OL>

.FAQ i Why does 127.0.0.1 not work with proxy servers?
<P>The problem is that if 127.0.0.1 is passed to the proxy server, it can't
resolve that back to your local machine. You can configure your browser so
that certain addresses (127.0.0.1) are not passed to the proxy.  This is
actually the browser being really silly, because this address never means
anything else than 'this machine'.

.FAQ i Why does my server address switch between 127.0.0.1 and 253.239.42.1?
<P>127.0.0.1 is always available (it's the local loopback address); the
other address is available when you're online and connected to the outside
world.

.FAQ i I want to test a site but my browser can't find 'www.myhost.com'
<P>Edit the 'hosts' file (in the Windows directory, and you may want to
rename 'hosts.sam' to 'hosts'), and point the your site name to 127.0.0.1.

.FAQ i What's the 'document root'?
<P>The document root is the directory where the main files are. For example
if someone asks for a file "http://somehost/index.htm", this is taken to
mean 'index.htm in the document root'. This is usually the directory called
'webpages' in the Xitami directory. So if you installed Xitami in c:\xitami,
the index.htm file would actually be in c:\xitami\webpages\index.htm. This
webpages directory can itself contain subdirectories, of course.

.FAQ i Do I need two computers to use Xitami?
<P>You can use one computer as a server, and one as a client if you like,
but you can also use the same computer as client and server. Xitami is so
small and fast that you can develop Java or CGI programs on the same system
you test them on, and you will not notice any slow-down. This is also a
simpler way of working than always copying your webstuff to another machine.
Just set your Xitami cgi-bin option to point to the directory where you
build your executables, or the webpages directory to your HTML directory
root.

.FAQ i Can I run Xitami on stand-alone machine?
<P>You can certainly run Xitami on a stand-alone system. It is a Good Idea
to have TCP/IP networking installed (on a PC, go for Win95, OS/2, or Linux,
which have TCP/IP built-in, instead of Win3.1 which is crippled in this
area). You must install TCP/IP correctly and at least have a dial-up adaptor
(software) configured. The 'ping localhost' command must work. Under Windows
the winsock library may want to dial-up when you initialise it (e.g.
connect from your browser), but this can be configured (in the browser or
Internet control panel) to not be necessary.

.FAQ i Can I run Xitami under DOS?
<P>Which version of DOS? We've not tested Xitami on a pure-DOS system, but
it does run in the DOS box of Windows 95. If you're looking for something
that will run on a PC without Windows, you could consider OS/2 or Linux:
both run Xitami very well and with minimum hardware.

.FAQ i Can I use Xitami over an ISDN or dial-in connection?
<P>Yes, if TCP/IP works and the 'ping' command does something useful. The
Same goes for X.25, frame-relay, carrier-pigeon, and telephone drums.

.FAQ i How do I change my IP address?
<P>By default, Xitami accepts connections on any available IP address.
If you have multiple IP addresses, Xitami accepts connections on all of
them.  More usually under Windows you have only one network card, only
one IP address (though with a dial-up connection you have two interfaces
and two addresses).  You can also configure Xitami to accept connections
on a specific address only.

.FAQ i Xitami is reporting the wrong server address!
<P>Xitami gets its name from the operating system.  Check the  TCP/IP
configuration and especially the computer name.  You  should be able to
test this using the 'ping' command in a DOS box.  Eg. 'ping mysystem'.

.FAQ i How do I tell Xitami to use my domain name?
<P>Xitami works with any of the IP addresses available on the system. It
does not care what the domain name is, and there is no way to define this
within Xitami. (When you use virtual hosts the situation changes a little:
there the domain name is used as a key to chose which virtual host to work
with.)

.FAQ i How do I move my web site to an Internet domain name?
<P>See the $(*beginners=Beginner's Guide) section. You have to do two main
things:
<UL>
<LI>Register a new domain name with Internic.
<LI>Get at least two existing machines to act as DNS servers for
this name.
</UL>
<P>This is usually only worth doing if you have your own system, permanently
connected to the Internet, or you want to rent a 'virtual host' on someone
else's system. In the first case, your ISP can usually help set things up.
In the second case, the virtual host provider will be able to help.

.FAQ i Can I set my hostname in xitami.cfg or defaults.cfg?
<P>You cannot set your system hostname here. You have to get this working at
the level of TCP/IP itself, e.g. by using the hosts file or a domain name
server (DNS). However, you can specify the hostname that's used in
redirected URLs, and this is important for virtual hosts.

.FAQ i My server keeps starting on port 160, why?
<P>Set server:portbase to 0, or remove the line. The HTTP port is at
portbase+80, and the FTP port at portbase+21.

.FAQ i Why does 'http://address/directory' does not work?
<P>This should work. Set server:debug to 1 and see what's going on in
debug.log. If you're on a PPP connection try setting server:translate to 0.

.FAQ i My images don't load, and various links give 'Not found'
<P>You can switch off image loading in the browser, but I doubt this is the
problem. More likely, you're using references that are incorrect for the
configuration you're using. Look at the HTML pages, and check the &lt;A
HREF&gt; tags. These must be valid. For example if they refer to some
hostname which is not accessible, the images won't load.

.FAQ i Why do my aliases not work?
<P>Set server:debug to 1 and see what's going on in debug.log. The WBA pages
provide a 'test' facility where you can type an URL, and Xitami tells you
what disk file it would be translated to.

.FAQ i How can I change the error 404 message in Xitami?
<P>Edit the file errors/text-404.

.FAQ i What's 'Vanilla' Xitami?
<P>This is just name for the portable, command-line version of Xitami.
Usually we use this term in contrast to the Windows GUI versions of the web
servers, which provide a graphical control panel for the web server.

.FAQ i Why is Xitami.aut not encoded?
<P>This is a temporary situation: we plan to release an update in 1998 that
uses encoded (hashed) passwords for better security. The password file
itself is not accessible to browsers, unless you specify the Xitami root
directory as its webpage directory, which would not really be a good idea.
There are also advantages to plain-text password files: it is simple to
manage these using scripts.

.FAQ i After running a script that modifies defaults.aut, how do I get -
the same script to restart the server?
<P>You don't need to, since Xitami will automatically reload its config,
including any modified password files, after a timeout that you can set as
required (the server:refresh option).

.FAQ i Can I use 'home.html' instead of 'default.htm'?
<P>Change the defaults.cfg file server:defaultn options. You can specify
anything you like: begin with 'default1'.

.FAQ i What is defaults.cfg?  I can't find it anywhere!
<P>Up to v1.3a, people had to modify the pre-supplied xitami.cfg file. This
worked fine until they installed a new version, at which point they could
start again. Defaults.cfg is not supplied with the server - you just copy
the part of xitami.cfg you want to modify. Eg.
<PRE>[CGI]
    debug=1
</PRE>

.FAQ i Why does my webmask (!xx.xx.*) not work?
<P>The webmask is a bit pedantic. This mask forbids all hosts in a certain
domain, but does not <I>allow</I> other hosts. Follow it by ',*' to allow
all other hosts: webmask=!xx.xx.*,*

.FAQ i How do I make my server run faster?
<P>Make sure the server:keep-alive option is enabled. Add lots of RAM to
your system and make sure this is available to your operating system disk
cache. Put your web site onto a RAM disk.  Don't use lazy, slow CGIs,
especially ones that search large databases. Change the priority under
Windows NT to 'High'.  Raise the keep alive limit to 100 or more under
Windows NT, or Unix (not under Win95 or your system will have problems).

.FAQ i How do I make my server secure?
<P>Firstly, consider buying Xitami/Pro which includes support for SSL/2,
SSL/3, and TLS.
<P>Then, understand that there are several standard ways to compromise a
system via a web server:
<UL>
<LI>protocol attacks at the TCP/IP level, mostly aimed at denial of service
attacks.  This depends on your operating system.
<LI>buffer-overflow attacks enabled by programming flaws which allow hackers
to write into the server code by using (for instance) very long URLs or
filenames.  Xitami is robust against these attacks.
<LI>all kinds of attacks based on CGI access.  This depends on who you allow
to put CGIs on your web server system.
</UL>
<P>The main protection is to run Xitami on a system that has no basic
security problems (i.e. Linux v.s NT), and to run it under a user id that
has minimum privileges (so that even through a buffer-overflow attack, the
hacker cannot do much damage). Disabling CGI is also a good idea. FTP does
not pose much risk either way, if you disallow uploading, which allows a DoS
attack (fill-up the hard disk).
<P>Here is Brian Westric's checklist for securing Xitami under Windows NT:
<OL>
<LI>Under Unix, set port to 8085 to allow use of guest account (note: this
doesn't work from web admin, one must edit the config file and restart the
server).
<LI>Start webserver as a service that uses a guest account. This account
will have read access to the webpage directories, and no access to other
directories.
<LI>Make sure cgi-bin directory is empty.
<LI>Disable directory browsing (in both cgi, and security sections).
<LI>Delete default user in default.aut.
<LI>Change admin password (by editing default.aut), and specify a su
password (in security tab).
<LI>Ftp: put port (offset) at -7984 so it runs at port 21 (otherwise, it
doesn't seem to work correctly, possibly an issue with my firewall).
<LI>Ftp: rename greeting, goodbye, userpermission, and dirpermission files.
<LI>Ftp: only have an anonymous user, and give them download permission in
one dir, upload in another.
<LI>Ftp: specify log directory for a different directory than main
directory.
</OL>

.FAQ i I want each user to have FTP access to their personal web pages
<P>You do not need aliases.  Simply assign each user a subdirectory of
the webpages directory, then specify this directory as their FTP home
directory (using a full path).
<P>You can also do it using aliases: create HTTP aliases which point into
the FTP space.  So, user Joe gets a FTP directory: 'ftproot/joe'.  Then
define a HTTP alias:

.FAQ i Does Xitami support http://ipaddress/~username?
<P>The ~username syntax is a UNIX thing; the UNIX shell translates ~username
into the home directory for a user. Xitami does not yet support this
automatically. However you can get much the same effect by creating a
subdirectory for each user underneath the webpages directory, called
'~username'.

.FAQ i In FTP, 'ls' fails from a remote system (it works locally)
<P>This is probably due to the remote machine being hidden by a router or
firewall which prevents return connections from the FTP server to the
client. You should use passive mode for such connections. The next release
of Xitami handles this situation better, but the basic problem is
unsolvable; if the client is behind a firewall or router that does not allow
reverse connections (i.e. server to client) then the default FTP protocol
does not work correctly.

.FAQ i No-one can get to my server.  I can get in, but no-one else can
<P>From Paul S R Chisholm and others...
<P>The 'ping' command (from the client to the server) is the simplest way
to make sure that there is a TCP/IP connection actually established.
However, because of "ping of death" attacks that have become popular over
the past year or so, a lot of routers have been shutting off ICMP. Thus,
ping doesn't work. traceroute (a.k.a. tracert) doesn't work either. This
last one really hurts, in my experience. There are other things to try:
<UL>
<LI>"telnet <hostname> 80", then type "HEAD /" <return><return>;
"Connection refused" means the host is accessible but the server isn't
listening (a Bad Thing(tm)).
<LI>"telnet <hostname> 32760"; you *should* get a "Connection refused"
(I presume nothing's listening on port 32760), which means the host is
accessible (a Good Thing(tm)).
</UL>
<P>You can still try ping and traceroute/tracert, but their failure may not
mean anything. (Their *success* is encouraging.)
<P>Another possible problem is that your server is behind a firewall or
proxy server which is preventing HTTP access (it may even allow ping to
work.)  If this is the case, see your network administrator for help.

.FAQ i No-one can connect to my server through the firewall!
<P>In some networks, your server may not even be addressable from beyond the
firewall. In this case you cannot do much. In other cases, the server is
addressable, but the firewall may be blocking some combination of ports and
protocols and addresses. If this is the case you may be able to convince the
network administrators to open-up access to your server on port 80.

.FAQ i Why does the Restart function not work?
<P>Some functions are not affected by the Restart function.  You cannot
modify the HTTP port through this function.  If you find that the Restart
function has no effect on the configuration change you made, you will
need to stop and restart the server program fully.

.FAQ i The browser is not showing my new pages
<P>There are various reasons why a browser will cache out-of-date pages.
These are the most common ones:
<UL>
<LI>The Reload action by itself will usually fetch pages from the browser
cache, not the web server.  Use Shift+Reload to force the browser to
actually get the page from the server.
<LI>Proxy servers use their own cache.  If your browser connects through a
proxy server, you may find it hard to force a reload.  Disable the proxy
connection, and connect directly to the web server.
<LI>Try flushing the browser disk cache.  It's pointless to flush the
browser's memory cache.
<LI>If you use the META 'expires' tag in the HTML pages, check that it's not
set to a future date.
<LI>If your HTML is generated dynamically (e.g. by a CGI program), check
that HTTP headers such as 'Expires:' and 'Last-Modified:' are correct.  If
in doubt, remove these headers.
</UL>

.FAQ i I get the wrong default page, even if I change the webpages root!
<P>If you load a default page, the browser caches it under a URL name with
no filename, e.g. 'http://localhost/'.  If you then switch to another
webpages root and request the same URL, the browser will compare dates and
load the current default page only if it's more recent.  You'll often find
that requesting the full filename will work correctly.  This problem can
occur if you upgrade to a new release of Xitami, then take a look at the
'Welcome to Xitami' default page.  If you then switch to your own config,
the browser won't show your default page.  This problem can also happen if
you run Xitami with different webpage roots, for instance to test different
sites.  The solution to the first case is to flush the browser cache.  In
the second case, disable the server:cache-defaults option.

.FAQ i I want several 'sites' on the same IP address, on different ports
<P>You can run several copies of Xitami, each in a different directory, and
each on a different port.  Xitami is small enough that this will not slow
down the system.  In each directory, create a suitable defaults.cfg file
with the server:portbase set to a different value.

.FAQ i How do I use Xitami on several different web projects?
<P>It's common to use Xitami to test different web projects on the same
system.  Generally we create a suitable root directory with the
defaults.cfg, authorisation, and other site-specific files, then run Xitami
in that directory.  Put the Xitami executable on the path.  You can also run
the Xitami command-line program (For Windows, xidos32.exe) with command-line
options to set the webpages, CGI, and FTP directories (-r, -c, -f).  It's a
good idea to set the server:cache-defaults option to 0 if you use this kind
of setup, so that default pages are always loaded correctly.

.FAQ i How does Xitami work with subdomains?
<P>Let's say you have a domain, like imatix.com, with a fixed IP address
(207.92.100.8 or something like that). The domain-name servers provided by
our web site providers (azc.com), handle the translation from imatix.com to
a numeric address.  For fun, we defined www.imatix.com and ftp.imatix.com to
point to the same address, i.e. the same network card on the same system.
It'd be quite possible to define further subdomains, all ending in
imatix.com, and all pointing to the same system.  We call these 'virtual
hosts' since each apparently distinct system, or host, actually comes back
to the same thing.  Xitami lets you define a specific profile for each
virtual host, which you can create using the WBA virtual host wizard.
All this works under the same single registered domain.

.FAQ i Where can I get (just) primary & secondary DNS hosting for cheap?
<P>Try the public DNS service at http://soa.granitecanyon.com/. It's free.
You can also try using a .nu domain instead of a .com one.  Go to
http://www.nunames.nu for info. They also link to a service that does the
full DNS service for $49.95/year.  nunames updates your DNS info with an
interactive program right on their web site and it's effective within 24-48
hours.  Similar services are available at www.tonic.to.

<H3>Windows 3.x Questions</H3>

.FAQH 3 Xitami does not work - why not?
<P>You need a TCP/IP winsock.dll.  And it has to work.  And it has to be
configured correctly.  If you have any kind of difficulty running Xitami
or connecting to it, use the PING command to debug your TCP/IP
configuration.  First, use 'ping 127.0.0.1' to check that TCP/IP is
working.  Then, use 'ping localhost' to check that winsock.dll is
working.  Next try ping with the system name that Xitami displays.
Then, try this command from another system.  All these must work before
you can use Xitami.

.FAQ 3 'Could not open HTTP port 80 - Protocol not known'
<P>Your TCP/IP protocol is not correctly installed.  Ping must work!
This is typically caused by inadequate winsock dialers that have incomplete
support for server applications.  Try Trumpet winsock, which we've been
told works.

.FAQ 3 Are there still plans to introduce CGI for Win 3.x?
<P>No.  We are moving off this platform in the long term.  You'll find that
the 32-bit console version of Xitami runs pretty well under Win32s, although
CGI does not work due to filesystem incompatibilities.  You <EM>can</EM>
write LRWP programs under Win32s.

.FAQ 3 When will FTP work in the Win 3.x version?
<P>This will never work, due to memory limitations. We've had reasonably
good results running the 32-bit console version on top of Win32s, and we
recommend you try this if you really need the FTP and other features (such
as WBA and LRWP) which are missing from the 16-bit version.

.FAQ 3 Why does xiwin16.exe use all my CPU?
<P>When idling, xiwin16.exe spends most of its time waiting for incoming
socket events. Under Windows 95 or NT, a 16-bit program that is waiting for
socket events looks like it is sitting on the entire CPU. Maybe it is.
Anything can happen in this business. However, as far as we can tell, the
program really is idling, and does not slow-down the system. If this bothers
you, move to Windows 95, and run the 32-bit version of Xitami. This uses
Windows threads (as well as its own internal multithreading) to reduce CPU
consumption to 1% or less when idling.

<HR>
<H3>Windows 95/98 Questions</H3>

.FAQH w Can I use my Win95 system as a real server?
<P>A decent web server like Xitami does not need large amounts of memory or
a blazing CPU. You can happily serve a group of several hundred users from a
486 PC with 16Mb memory. If you want to run heavy CGI programs, you'll need
a faster system. Also, a fast hard disk is a good idea. And of course, any
server is limited to the speed of the network. Given a fast hard disk and a
fast network, Xitami will be able to handle several hits per second even on
a slow 486 PC, and dozens of hits per second on a fast Pentium. (One hit per
second is equivalent to about 20 users actively browsing, at the rate of a
page per minute where a page requires about 3 accesses. If an average user
browses for an hour a day, one hit per second thus translates into 100-150
users.) Note that the earlier releases of Win95 are not really too stable.
<P>Note also that Win95 and Win98 appear to be unstable when they are very
heavily loaded; this does not happen with WinNT, and we assume this is done
deliberately, since in principle the TCP/IP code is shared between these
systems (at least the later Win95 releases).  Windows 95/98 leak memory when
the TCP/IP stack is heavily used.  If you want to run a web server on a
small cheap system, use Linux.

.FAQ w Can I use ASP (Active Server Pages) with Xitami?
<P>If you have Visual Basic 5.0, you can convert your ASP pages with the VB
conversion module provided in the server pack. You will need to make some
modifications to the ASP code. You can then compile it as an executable
program, and run it as a normal CGI program.

.FAQ w 'Could not open HTTP port 80 - Protocol not known'
<P>Your TCP/IP protocol is not correctly installed. Try these steps:
<UL>
<LI>Open the Windows control panel and open the Network icon.
<LI>You need to have at least one network adaptor: if you do not have a
network card in your PC you can install the 'dial-up' adaptor: choose
'Add...', then choose network adaptor, and choose the dial-up adaptor from
Microsoft.
<LI>You then need to add a protocol, TCP/IP, and allow Windows to install
the necessary files.
<LI>When you reboot, you can check that 'ping 127.0.0.1' works. If it does,
go ahead with Xitami and Internet Explorer. If it does not work, you need to
get hold of someone who can help.
</UL>

.FAQ w 'Port is already used by another server (WSEADDRINUSE)'
<P>You are running another web server (perhaps MS PWS) - remove it then
run Xitami.  In some cases you may have to edit the registry; look for
a key 'Runservices' and delete any references to previous web servers.
You can also run Xitami on another port by changing the server:portbase
option, e.g.:
<PRE>[Server]
    portbase=1000
</PRE>
To run the HTTP service on port 1080 and the FTP service on port 1021.

.FAQ w 'How do I run PWS and Xitami on the same system?'
<P>Using regedit, edit your registry:
<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/
System/
CurrentControlSet/
Control/
ServiceProvider/
ServiceType/
W3SVC/
</PRE>
TcpPort will be set at 50 (hex), value must be changed to 901f (hex) for
port 8080.  Reboot your system.   If you're running FrontPage, FP Ext's must
be uninstalled and reinstalled again.  

.FAQ w 'Your browser sent a malformed request'
<P>Check you're not using a Wingate proxy server or something similar on
Xitami's port.  If you are, switch Wingate to port 90.

.FAQ w How can I tell what TCP/IP ports are assigned?
<P>You can find out which TCP/IP ports are being used with:
<PRE>netstat -a
</PRE>
or "netstat -na" if you don't have good DNS access. But this won't tell you
what programs are using them. Under some Unixes you can use something like
lsof (list open files) to find out the program using them; but I'm not aware
of any equivalent for Windows 95. With Xitami stopped, try running the
netstat command and look for a line with ":80" in it (or ":http") in the
local address part; which indicates that something is using port 80. If
there is, you'll have to dig around and see if you can find what it is.

.FAQ w My URLs starting with file:// don't work across the network
<P>When you use a URL starting with file://, this is not handled by Xitami
at all, but by the browser which picks-up the file from the local system.
Xitami can handle URLs starting with http: and ftp:.

.FAQ w Tips for using Xitami with dynamic IP addresses
<P>From Alex Feinerg a.k.a Yoonicks@EFNet and others...
<UL>
<LI>Get a DYNAmic Domain. There is a free one: http://www.ml.org: subscribe
to Monolith and register a dynamic domain. You will need to know your ip
every time you reconnect so you can update it.  Under Windows 95/NT, use
winipcfg to see your IP address.
<LI>With Monolith Dynamic IP you can use vhosts.  Just check the button
"Use wild card aliases". All under your-domain.dyn.ml.org will resolve to
your ip. Now use Xitami's vhost feature to perform these tasks so you can run
two sites of one computer.
<LI>Protect yourself with a firewall. Get a windows PC firewall from Conseal
(http://www.signal9.com).  It's not freeware but is very useful.  It blocks
ICMP, UDP and some TCP connections and is configurable.  For Linux/Unix use
ipwadm.
<LI>Does your ISP disconect if you are idle?  If it does write a program that
does a certain task every 10-15 minutes. Here is a script for mirc irc client
(add this to aliases): <TT>aidle { timer 0 600 /say . }</TT>.
<LI>Other addresses to try: http://www.iceinc.net/DynamIP/, and
http://www.dynip.com.
</UL>

.FAQ w Tips for using a dial-up IP connection
<UL>
<LI>Disable dial-on-demand; this option causes the winsock library to try to
connect each time you initialise it. (In MSIE3, choose View, Options,
Connection, and clear the option 'Connect to the Internet as needed'; for
MSIE4, tell it you have a LAN connection, not a modem connection). At the
best, this option will cause you delay and expense when you try to browse
local pages. At the worst it can cause long timeouts while your browser
tries to resolve names.
<LI>If you have an early release of Windows 95, install the dial-up
networking upgrade (last seen somewhere in the vicinity of the MS ISDN
dial-up package).
<LI>Enable Xitami's server:autostart option.  Then you can start Xitami at
boot time, and it'll wait until the dial-up connection is ready.
</UL>

.FAQ w Ping will find 127.0.0.1 but not <I>myhost</I>.com
<P>Ping is a good test to see if your computer name can be translated
correctly. If you're on the Internet, you need to ask your Internet service
provider to make the necessary DNS entries. On your own PC, you can edit the
'hosts' file in the Windows directory. The file 'hosts.sam' is a sample that
you can rename to 'hosts'. Then, add your machine name and 127.0.0.1. This
may not always work; address translation may require that you are actually
on-line. For instance, I can 'ping 127.0.0.1' at any time. When I try to
'ping localhost', I get the TCP/IP dial-up dialog. I can Cancel this, and
then 'ping localhost' works. But to ping my machine name, I must be online.

.FAQ w How do I debug my Windows network connection?
<P>Windows 95 includes two tools besides ping to test TCP/IP connections:
tracerout and winipcfg. With tracert, you can follow the route for a TCP/IP
connection. Open a DOS prompt and type the command: tracert
<I>somehost.com</I>. The program shows the route to the host, up to 30 hops.
Type tracert with no arguments to get help. Winipcfg shows you your IP
address(es) and some more information about your network.  Just type
winipcfg; it's a Windows program.

.FAQ w Xitami just sits there blinking between 'Running' and 'Suspended'
<P> The server is trying to start up, but there is a problem with the TCP/IP
connection. Its default reaction prior to release 2.3c was to wait and try
again, it blinks between 'Running' and 'Suspended'. You can edit the
defaults.cfg file to include these lines:
<PRE>[server]
    autostart=0
</PRE>
which disables the autostart function. You can also check the xitami.log
file to see what error messages Xitami has logged.  If you get a message
like 'Port is already used', check that no other web server is already
running.

.FAQ w I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on aliases
<P>For security, Xitami does not allow access through short filenames when a
long filename is defined. Without this check, it's possible to bypass
user/password authentication by using the shortened name for a long name, or
vice-versa. When you get this error, the xitami.log file will say '- request
refers to an illegal filename'. One consequence of this security check is
that if you use short filenames in your alias or webpages definition, all
requests through to those files will be rejected with a 403 error (not
authorized). Use the full long filenames in alias or webpages definitions,
or if the security issue does not bother you, set the security:safepaths
option to 0.

.FAQ w I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on other URLs
<P>There are a number of specific reasons why Xitami may return this:
<OL>
<LI>The resource you are accessing is protected by a 'webmask' definition
which excludes your PC.
<LI>You are trying to browse a directory, but directory listings have not
been enabled.
<LI>You are trying to use an HTTP update method (PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY)
on a resource which has not been authorised for this.
<LI>You are trying to run the WBA, but this has been disabled by the
security:admin option.
<LI>The URL refers to a Windows short filename when a long filename also
exists.  Xitami rejects this as being a potential security violation.
You can switch this behaviour off by setting security:safepaths to 0.
<LI>You're trying to do a HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation, and
specified an absolute Content-Location: or Destination: URI which did not
have the same path as the request URI.  Xitami rejects this because the
authorisation was carried-out on the request URL, and using a different path
for the Content-Location: or Destination: URL would violate this.
<LI>A HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation failed because of an access
violation at the operating system level - for instance Xitami tried to write
to a file which was marked as read-only.
</OL>
<P>In most of these cases, the reason for the error will be logged when you
enable server debugging.

.FAQ w How do I change my 'web server address'?
<P>Xitami gets its host name from the operating system - i.e. Windows. Your
IP address is not something that Xitami can change or choose. Check your
network configuration and if neccessary, ask your network administrator. The
same applies to the hostname that Xitami displays. This is the name of the
system as supplied by Windows. You can change this in the network control
panel.

.FAQ w My web server address is 'http://default/' - why?
<P>Check the TCP/IP configuration; your system is probably called 'default'.

.FAQ w Can I run RealServer on the same system as Xitami?
<P>Yes, but change RealServer's port from 80 to something else (e.g. 1024).

.FAQ w My 16-bit CGI program does not output anything
<P>You cannot correctly run a 16-bit CGI program that is on a path with
'long filenames'. For instance, if you installed Xitami in 'C:\Program
Files\Xitami', then put a 16-bit CGI into the cgi-bin subdirectory, it will
run, but its output is lost, and the browser will eventually time out and
show a message like 'Document contains no data'. The fix is to either move
Xitami to a directory like 'C:\Xitami' or create a CGI alias and put the CGI
programs elsewhere than under the Xitami root.

.FAQ w How do I use the FrontPage extensions with Xitami?
<P>The FrontPage server extensions are not documented and as far as we have
been able to test, they do not work with Xitami under UNIX or under Windows
NT.  Support for specific servers appears to be added at the whim of
Microsoft, so you may want to try writing Bill Gates a sweet letter.  We're
not in the business of reverse-engineering Microsoft software.

.FAQ w Win95 crashes with a GPF in VxD IFSMGR(01)
<P>Upgrade to a more recent version of Windows 95.  There are several known
problems with the winsock library and Win95 kernel in pre-1998 releases of
Win95.  See the question below on miscellaneous Win95 crashes.

.FAQ w Win95 crashes with a GPF in WINMM.DLL
<P>Check whether you are running Win95 with service pack 1 (also called
OSR-2.1).  In 'My Computer', select Properties, and you'll see the version
number.  If you have 950a (service pack 1), you need to upgrade to 950b.
As far as we know this is only available as an OEM CD-ROM.

.FAQ w Win95 gives me an error 10055 - Out of buffer space
<P>This can happen when you load the TCP/IP system heavily by running lots
of servers.  There is no cure except to switch to WinNT, OS/2, or Linux.

.FAQ w Win95 still gives me errors when I use Xitami
<P>Apply the various Windows 95 'service packs' and updates.  This is our
list as of August 1998:
<UL>
<LI>W95setup.exe - Windows 95 Service Pack 1, 31 Dec 95
<LI>W95oleupd.exe - Windows 95 OLE 32 Update, 24 Jan 96
<LI>mspwlupd.exe - Windows 95 Password List Update, 17 May 96
<LI>W95krnlupd.exe - Windows 95 Kernel 32 Update, 29 Jul 97
<LI>W95ws2setup.exe - Windows 95 Windows Sockets 2 Update, 19 Feb 98
</UL>

.FAQ w Xitami crashes as soon as I try to start it
<P>Check your clock; Xitami is known to crash if the clock is set to later
than the year 2038.

.FAQ w When I access my local site, it takes 3-4 minutes to load!
<P>Change the Internet Control Panel not to autodial. (In MSIE3, choose
View, Options, Connection, and clear the option 'Connect to the Internet as
needed'; for MSIE4, tell it you have a LAN connection, not a modem
connection).

.FAQ w Why does Xitami use all my CPU?
<P>You probably set the priority to 'High'.  This is excellent if you do not
use the system for anything else, but is not a good idea if Xitami shares
the system with other users.  At high priority, Xitami will consume most of
the CPU time during large downloads.  We do recomment High priority for a
dedicated web server, and 'Normal' for a mixed-use system.

.FAQ w When I run a CGI, I get a blank screen for several seconds
<P>Check that you've not configured your MS-DOS command window to appear
full-screen. When the Xitami web server launches the CGI program, it does so
in a way that says don't create a console window for the application.
However, if the command window agent is configured for full screen, it
switches first to full screen before making the test for putting up a
console window which causes the blank screen to appear (sometimes with a
blinking cursor). There doesn't appear to be a way of preventing this
behaviour programmatically.
<OL>
<LI>Open the Start menu and choose Settings, Taskbar... and Start Menu
Programs. Click on the Advanced button and find the 'MS-DOS Prompt' object
in the Programs folder.
<LI>Right mouse button click on the 'MS-DOS Prompt' object and choose the
Properties option.
<LI>Select the 'Screen' tab and set the usage to 'Window', not 'Full
Screen'.
</OL>

.FAQ w How do I reinstall just one file from the Xitami kit?
<P>Use unzip (WinZip, etc.) on the installation .exe file.  This file is
compatible with the zip format.

.FAQ w Xitami is reporting errors on its control panel
<P>Xitami reports 'Not Found', and any other 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx return
code as an error on its control panel.

.FAQ w Can I run multiple instances under Windows?
<P>You can run multiple instances of xiwin32.exe or xidos32.exe in separate
directories (each with its own web space, config files, etc) and specify the
portbase either on the command line or in the defaults.cfg file.

.FAQ w IE sometimes fails with multiframe documents
<P>Microsoft IE 3.0 has occasional problems mixing keep-alive connections
with highly-framed documents. The symptoms are that the last frames will not
display. IE opens a connection, asks for a document, but prematurely closes
the frame. Workarounds: use Navigator, a more recent version of IE (we
assume the problem may be fixed), or switch-off keep-alive if you are using
heavily-framed documents.

.FAQ w Windows says 'URL.DLL not found' when I choose 'Setup'
<P>URL.DLL is a Windows DLL that is installed as part of TCP/IP networking,
and allows you to double-click a .htm file to launch a browsers. Xitami uses
this technique to launch a browser when you click on the 'Setup' button. You
can either try installing TCP/IP networking (again) or start a browser and
enter the URL 'http://127.0.0.1/admin' yourself.  This file may only be on
the OSR/1 release of Windows, or may be supplied with MSIE or Navigator 4.

.FAQ w Why is Windows ignoring my changes to the hosts.sam file?
<P>This file must be called "hosts", without an extension.

.FAQ w What's CGI/Win?
<P>The CGI/Win protocol (which Xitami does not support) uses a mechanism for
transferring the stdin/stdout and environment data that is different from
the normal CGI manner. It's meant to support languages like Visual Basic
that do not have access to stdin/stdout streams.

.FAQ w Do you know of a good free proxy server for Windows?
Louis C. Lupin says: VSocks is a freeware Socks 4 proxy. It's easy to set-up
and use.  See http://www.pscs.co.uk/software/support/vsockslight.html.

.FAQ w Do you know of a good free e-mail server for Windows?
<P>Thomas Schroeter says: On www.freeware.com, I found a very good server
(VPOP3) which includes POP 3, SMTP, finger connections, forwarding accounts
and autoresponders. The program has a lot of settings (user accounts,
headers, listserver, logging, error reporting, ...). It runs with Windows 95
and it's very fast. Now, I'm using Xitami and VPOP3 together - both programs
are working very well in my local network.
<P>Justin Scott says: Try the freeware version of SLMail .. it supports
upto 6 users, and an autoresponder. It's a commercial-grade e-mail server
for Win95/NT. If you want more than the 6 users available in the freeware
version, you'll have to get the standard edition for win95 (SLMail v2.6),
which runs for about $200 (go with the freeware). It is available from
Seattle Labs at www.seattlelab.com. Hope you find it useful (I know I do :).
<P>Ian Hayes says: For Win95/NT you can get a nice little SMTP server called
JSMail at http://j-bg.demon.co.uk It does SMTP, POP3, finger, autoresponders
and you can reject mail based on Received: lines, source or subject words.
Reverse DNS, anti-relay, and RBL support (for those interested). Of course,
you'll still need a domain, and when mailing to certian domains, an MX
record. Monolith provides both for free. You can run it as a service or from
the command line. Takes up very little resources.

.FAQ w Do you know of a mail client for Windows?
<P><A href="http://www.imatix.com/pub/tools/mailto.zip">Mailto</A> is a small,
free, and simple mail client by Scott Beasley, author of the SFL sflmail
module. This program lets you send e-mails from within CGI programs, with
attachments. Mailto.exe even runs as a configurable CGI mail form program.
This package is only about 35K.

.FAQ w Any hints for boosting Xitami's performance?
<UL>
<LI>Set virtual memory yourself.  If Windows handles this, the swap file
changes constantly, thus slowing your system.  You should set both the
min/max virtual memory to 1 1/2 to 3 times the physical memory in your
computer.
<LI>Create a RAM disk for Perl if you use a lot of CGIs. A RAM disk is fast,
and reloaded at boot time. You should use RAM disks for read-only data only.
To put Perl onto a RAM disk, use a disk with 512-byte sectors and about 1.2
Mb space. Use a line like this in config.sys:
<PRE>DEVICEHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1200 512 /E
</PRE>
where 1200 is the size and 512 is the sector size. Windows will attach the
next available free drive letter to it (e.g. 'R:'). If you want to load Perl
onto the RAM disk automatically, at boot time, add some commands to your
autoexec.bat:
<PRE>md r:\perl
xcopy32 e:\perl\bin\perl*.* r:\perl
xcopy32 e:\perl\bin\cmd*.* r:\perl
PATH %PATH%;R:\PERL
set PERLLIB=E:\PERL\LIB
</PRE>
This assumes that you leave the Perl libraries on the hard disk (here, E:).
If you want a full-blown Perl on a RAM disk, you'll need about 6Mb of space.
<LI>Create a RAM disk for commonly-used web pages and graphics.
<LI>In the Win95 System control panel, under Performance, File System, set
the 'Typical Role' to 'Network Server'.  We have reports that this improves
system performance under heavy loads.
</UL>

.FAQ w Why does Win95 insist on running 'service.bat'?
<P>Xitami installs this batch file when you install the Xitami Console
version as a Windows 95 service. The service.bat file simply sets the
correct working directory, then starts Xitami. To disable this, you can edit
service.bat to remove the call to xidos32.exe. You can also remove the entry
for service.bat in the registry; run regedit and find the key
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices. You'll see a
definition for service.bat, which you can delete.

.FAQ w I installed MSIE 5 and uninstalled it, and now Xitami crashes -
whenever I try to start it up.
<P>Yes, indeed.  Well, what do you expect when you install and then remove
half of your operating system?  Probably the only cure is to format the hard
drive, and install a clean copy of Windows 95 or 98.  Maybe reinstalling
MSIE 5 will help.

.FAQ w I'd like to run an abitrary Windows program from a browser
<P>Okay, but be warned that this opens your system to arbitrary abuse. You
cannot launch a Windows program directly, since a CGI program runs as a
hidden console (DOS) process. However, it's trivial via a small batch file,
which itself starts the Windows program. For instance, here's a batch file
that starts any program at all using the CGI argument, e.g.
"/cgi-bin/run?notepad", where run.bat contains just 3 characters: "@%1".

.FAQ w Can I stop Xitami from the command line or a batch script?
<P>You can use the wmkill.exe program supplied with Xitami. Wmps.c and
wmkill.exe were written by Thomas Grobicki of Avilar Technologies to perform
the functions of the Unix ps and kill commands for Windows 95/98 and NT. To
kill Xitami, use this command:
<PRE>wmkill -exact -titles -icons "Xitami Web Server"
</PRE>
To see the syntax for wmkill or wmps, type 'wmkill -help' or 'wmps -help'.

<H3>Windows NT Questions</H3>

.FAQH n My 16-bit CGI program does not output anything
<P>Under Windows NT, you cannot run 16-bit CGIs at all, due to a limitation
of the Windows 32-16 bit interface. A simple workaround is to use a batch
file like this:
<PRE>@echo off
mycgi.exe &gt; temp.tmp
type temp.tmp
</PRE>

.FAQ n The Xitami service can't access a network drive
<P>The problem is one of security; the service runs under the account
'system' by default, and this may not have access to your network drive. In
the Services control panel, you can change the start-up options for the
Xitami service so that it logs-on as a user with the necessary privileges.

.FAQ n The Xitami service fails to start, saying 'Access is denied'.
<P>You should install Xitami when logged-on as administrator. You can fix
this quite simply. In a DOS box, go to the Xitami directory and type
'xiwinnt -u' to uninstall the service. Now log-on as administrator and use
'xiwinnt -i' to re-install the service. If you still have the problem,
de-install Xitami completely, and re-install after logging-on as
administrator.

.build anchor start_service
.FAQ n The Xitami service still fails to start!
<P>Search for the string "xiwinnt.exe", which may appear as follows:
<PRE>KEY         VALUE
ImagePath   c:\program files\xitami\xiwinnt.exe
</PRE>
The space in 'program files' is what's bothering NT. Change the key data to
this:
<PRE>KEY         VALUE
ImagePath   "c:\program files\xitami\xiwinnt.exe"
</PRE>

.FAQ n Can I restart the Xitami service from a batch file?
<PRE>net stop xitami
net start xitami
</PRE>

.FAQ n How do I remove the Xitami icon in my control panel area?
<P>When you installed the Xitami service, it installed the Xitami control
panel file in the Windows System directory. Delete the file called
'xiwinntc.cpl'. If you install and uninstall the NT service version, this
file gets left behind due to an access conflict (which we have not
figured-out how to resolve). (Details: if you use the 'Add/remove software
components' control panel option, then the Xitami CPL is loaded, and can't
be deleted...)

.FAQ n I defined a new VH and now my NT service won't run
<P>Check that the specified .aut file exists, even if it's just empty. Check
the Xitami log files for error messages. If in doubt, run the console
version to see what error message is being produced.

.FAQ n When I try to install Xitami on NT 4 I get a dialog box that says -
"Corrupt installation detected"
<P>Could be that the install .exe has indeed been corrupted. Try downloading
it again and trying again. If this fails you could be seeing a problem with
the 16-bit subsystem in NT. Did you install any service packs? (I think SP2
or 3 fixed this problem...) In any case you can easily install from the .zip
file; if you're using the service version, install it by copying the .cpl
file to the Windows system directory, and run 'xiwinnt -i'.

.FAQ n Can I use 'srvany' with Xitami?
<P>Yes, this is a good way to run the console version as a service. You can
get srvany from the NT resource kit, or you can download it from MSDN (the
Microsoft Developer Network web site).  The following tips were provided by
Ignacio "Iggie" Bustamante.
<OL>
<LI>Copy SRVANY.EXE and INSTSRV.EXE to your NT system directory and install
it as a Windows NT service for Xitami, for example:
<PRE>instsrv Xitamiweb c:\winnt\System32\srvany.exe
</PRE>
This will set the preliminary entries for a service named "Xitami" (choose
your own name).
<LI>Specify the application to start and its parameters:
  <UL>
    <LI>Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT32.EXE), and open the registry at
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Xitamiweb.
    <LI>Create a "DependOnService' value of type REG_MULTI_SZ and specify
    the services that should be started before launching Xitami; mamely, Tcpi
    and Afd. For example:
    <PRE>DependOnService: REG_MULTI_SZ Tcpip Afd</PRE>
    You will be presented with a multi-entry screen.  Just hit [Enter] after
    each entry.  You can add other services here if you wish.
    <LI>Create a 'Parameters' key.  Under the Parameters key, create an
    'Application' value of type REG_SZ and specify the full path of the Xitami
    executable (including the extension), for example:
    <PRE>Application: REG_SZ: C:\Xitami\Xiwin32.exe</PRE>
    <LI>Additionally, under the Parameters key, create an 'AppDirectory' value
    of type REG_SZ and specify the current directory to use for Xitami, for
    example:
    <PRE>AppDirectory: REG_SZ: C:\Xitami</PRE>
  </UL>
<LI>Under Settings-> Control Panel-> Services, select Startup for Xitami.
Set Startup Type:  "Automatic", set Log On As: Select "This Account", and
enter the appropiate Username and Password for an Administrative account.
</OL>
This should do it.  Note that NT will report that the service was started
successfully even if there was an error.  Always test Xitami after changing
its configuration by running it as a console program (with the service
stopped).  When the service has started, test the server and check its log
files for possible errors.

<H3>UNIX Questions</H3>

.FAQH u Xitami does not build on my XXXX system
<P>Xitami should build on: IBM AIX, Digital UNIX, HP/UX, Sun Solaris, SCO
OpenUNIX, SCO OpenServer, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Sinix, and of course Linux.
Anything else is unexplored territory, and that includes the future, since
some of these systems are starting to come without an ANSI C compiler as
standard.

.FAQ u I need to search /usr/src/linux/include/ at build time
<P>The Xitami build uses a script, 'c', that lets you specify additional
compiler options by setting the CCDEFINES variable. So, to specify an
additional include directory, use shell commands like this before starting
xibuild:
<PRE># CCDEFINES="-I/usr/src/linux/include"
# export CCDEFINES
# ./xibuild
</PRE>

.FAQ u Can I run Xitami from my ISP telnet account?
<P>Yes, if you have access to an ANSI C compiler. Build Xitami as usual, and
run it with a command like this: 'xitami -b 5000 -s'. Avoid port 8080 which
is often used for proxies. You may also find that the ISP kill all
long-running processes at regular intervals (e.g. midnight). The -s switch
runs Xitami in the background; it's a bit cleaner than using 'nohup'.

.FAQ u Does Xitami support .htaccess with per-directory access control?
<P>No, Xitami uses its own .aut files for access control.

.FAQ u How can I run Xitami and have it listen on port 80 under Unix?
<P>Under Unix, only processes that are running as root are able to listen
for new connections to TCP/IP ports less than 1024, including the well
known HTTP port 80.  So for Xitami to listen for connections on port 80
it needs to be run as root.  And of course there must not be another web
server running that is already listening for connections to port 80.
There are three ways that you could do this:
<OL>
<LI>Log in, or su, to root, and start up Xitami.
<LI>Have Xitami started during the startup scripts when the machine boots.
<LI>Make Xitami "setuid root".
</OL>
Which is best?  It depends.  (In the real world the answer is always "it
depends"; why do they never accept that in exams?)
<UL>
<LI>If you just want to run Xitami occassionally on your own system then
starting it up manually by logging in as root, or su'ing to root, is the
best idea, because it ensures only people with the root password can run
programs as root.
<LI>If you want Xitami running all the time on your Unix system then having
it started automatically from the boot scripts is best, and by default
it will then start running as root, letting it listen on port 80.  
Exactly how to set this up varies from Unix system to Unix system, so
look in the documentation for your Unix system.
<LI>If your Unix system is only used by you, or just by people that you
trust, and you don't want Xitami running all the time, and you don't
want people to log in (or su) to root, then setting Xitami "setuid root"
might be a suitable option for you.
</UL>
To make Xitami "setuid root" after compiling it:
<PRE>% su
# chown root xitami
# chgrp www xitami
# chmod 4770 xitami
# exit
%
</PRE>
where "www" is a Unix group that contains the users that should be able to
start Xitami. Then the users that can run Xitami will be able to start it
running as root, just by running it.  If you do decide to set Xitami "setuid
root" beware that this is a potiental security risk, because it means that
users without the root password can start the server running, and if they
discover a bug in Xitami or a program run by Xitami they may be able to get
root access to other things on the machine.
<P>iMatix does not recommend setting Xitami "setuid root" except in
situations where only people who can be trusted to run any program as root
have access to log in to the machine, such as a personal Unix box. Even in
this situation the use of a program like "sudo" should be investigated as a
possible alternative.  Please also take a look at the next question
concerning security aspects.

.FAQ u What are the security implications of running Xitami as root?
<P>From Xitami 2.4b onwards it has been possible to request Xitami to change
to a different user id and group id from the one that it was started in, for
most of the time it is running.  To do this in the [Security] section of
defaults.cfg put:
<PRE>[Security]
    setuid=1
    setuid-user=www
    setuid-group=www
</PRE>
assuming you have a "www" user and a "www" group (this is a common setup for
Web Servers, but not universal). The default for setuid-user is "nobody" and
the default for setuid-group is "nogroup", but using "www" for user and
group is better if you have them available (or can add them).  The user and
group privileges you choose will have to be sufficient to allow Xitami to
write to all the log files it needs, and run the programs it needs (eg,
cgi-bin programs).
<P>When [Security] setuid=1 is used Xitami changes the effective user id and
group id to the ones specified. However it also retains the privileges with
which it was started (commonly in this situation root privileges), in order
to be able to reopen the TCP/IP port it is listening on and so on.
<P>Currently Xitami runs cgi-bin programs with the same privileges as it is
running itself.  This means that when [security] setuid=1 is used, cgi-bin 
programs will be started with the effective user and group set as
configured in the [security] section, but still with the user id with
which it was started saved away (typically the "root" user id).
<P>If Xitami is started as root (or has been "setuid root" (see above)), 
and using [security] setuid=1 a malicious cgi-bin program could recover 
the saved root privileges and then do nasty things.  It also means that 
if someone finds an exploitable bug in your cgi-bin program, they might 
be able to trick the program into recovering the root privileges and
running a program as root.  All of this means that, as always, you need 
to be especially careful about checking cgi-bin programs for security 
issues.
<P>Work is under way adding the ability for Xitami to run cgi-bin programs
with different privileges from the ones which it is running as, including
permanently discarding any saved privileges, which will further reduce this
risk. This enhanced version will also include the ability to run the cgi-bin
program with a different "root directory" from the one that Xitami is using,
for additional security.

.FAQ u What's the best Linux operating system? RedHat, Debian, FreeBSD...?
<P>Ewen McNeill says: Firstly, FreeBSD isn't a Linux operating system; it's
a BSD-derived operating system. I haven't used it myself, but a number of
large sites do use it and seem to be quite happy with it (eg, cdrom.com).
Earlier versions of Xitami compiled and run under FreeBSD, but I'm not sure
if anyone has tried with recent versions -- it should either run or be
pretty simple to fix so it'll run.
<P>Of the rest (RedHat, Debian, OpenLinux) I wouldn't expect much difference
between them in terms of ability to handle load, etc. (Same for Slackware,
Suse, etc as well.) They're all based around the same Linux kernels, and
that (along with the web server) are the main things that'll affect
stability, speed, etc (given the same hardware).
<P>The main reason for choosing between the difference Linux distributions
is the packaging of software they give you. Both RedHat (which uses RPM) and
Debian (which uses .deb packages) have flexible package managers which will
let you automatically install pre-compiled software, and make sure that any
other programs that are needed to use them get installed too. RedHat has
more GUI administration tools, but I've heard that it's more fussy about you
using them too (that is, editing files by hand doesn't work so wel). Debian
mostly has command line admin tools, which is good if you're used to that
sort of thing (I like it). OpenLinux, Suse, etc, I don't know that much
about -- but Suse is apparently very popular in Europe, and LinuxJournal are
offering a copy of it with new subscriptions at present (at least they were
in July). (I've installed some Slackware systems in the past and having
tried Debian wouldn't switch back. Slackware seems to handle the basic
install okay, but it's not so good on helping you keep your system up to
date; Debian is very good at helping you keep your system up to date.
<P>Personally my systems are all Debian systems -- but I like the command
line tools, and the (dpkg) package manager, and tend to install systems
without X.

.FAQ u Why does the documentation always use DOS-style slashes?
<P> All recent versions of Xitami treat \ and / as identical, so the
distinction is purely for the benefit of the server administrator. (Actually
there is one exception, which is the \\ used to identify a remote file
system under Windows. This must be entered as \\, not //.) We generally aim
the documentation at Windows users, since these make-up the large majority
of our user base. We also expect that Unix users are able to make the mental
translation from \ to /.  Use / on Unix and either / or \ on Windows.

<HR>
<H3>OS/2 Questions</H3>

.FAQH o Xitami does not start, and 'ping 127.0.0.1' does not work
<P>Check the interfaces and routing with "netstat -r"; a "127.0.0.1"
host with the interf(ace) of "lo" ought to be present if it is going
to work.  The following command ought to establish a loopback
connection: "ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up".

.FAQ o Xitami reports 'too many open files'
<P>Add this environment variable definition 'SET EMXOPT=-h120' to your
config.sys.  However, note the following point.

.FAQ o Xitami aborts when my site is very heavily used
<P>EMX has a default limit of 20-40 open sockets; when you hit this,
programs start to abort or freeze.  Check the $(*emx=section) on configuring
EMX.

<H3>Application Programming Questions</H3>

.FAQH c How do I write CGIs?
<P>There must be hundreds of places to get a good answer to this question.
Look at the example programs in the cgi-src directory.

.FAQ c What's a good source for CGI programs?
<P>Try <A HREF="www.cgi-resources.com">www.cgi-resources.com</A>.

.FAQ c When I run a CGI program, I don't get any response
<P>Run your CGI in a DOS box and check first that it actually runs without
errors.  Then, check that whether it prints a first line starting with
'HTTP/'.  If it does this, it must also generate a correct 'Content-Length'
header.  This is vital if the server uses Keep-Alive connections, which is
the default configuration.  You can disable Keep-Alive, but this makes
things work slower.  The best solution is to <I>not</I> produce neither the
'HTTP/' first line, nor the 'Content-Length' line.  These just cause
problems.

.FAQ c I can't get PHP to run with Xitami!
<P>This is a step-by-step guide to installing and using PHP 3 with Xitami under
Windows.  Under Unix, the issue is probably similar, but we've not tested
it.
<OL>
<LI>First off, make sure Xitami is installed and running.
<LI>Next, download and install the PHP binary distribution into some
directory.  We'll assume it's c:\php.
<LI>Add '.php=c:\php\php.exe' to the Filter section of the Xitami confguration.
<LI>Rename the PHP initialisation file, 'php3.ini-dist' to 'php3.ini' and
copy it into the Windows directory.  Don't bother trying to set the PHPRC
environment variable, because this does not seem to work.
<LI>Edit the ini file and change the 'extension_dir' setting to c:\php.
<LI>Now test PHP by hand with a small test page, by running it in a command
window, in the Xitami directory:
<PRE>c:\php\php webpages\test.php
</PRE>
<LI>When that works, you should be able to use PHP pages from in a browser.
</OL>

.FAQ c Does Xitami have an API like ISAPI or NSAPI?
<P>We support WSX and LRWP directly, and ISAPI through an LRWP add-on. WSX
lets you build plugins that are linked into the server; LRWP lets you build
external peer processes that handle specific URLs. WSX programs are written
using the iMatix SMT library, in C. LRWP programs can be written in C, Java,
Python, Perl, or any other language that supports sockets.

.FAQ c Would you recommend CGI or WSX for a simple e-mail application?
<P>CGI is much simpler.  There is lots of information about CGI on the Net.

.FAQ c How do I tell Xitami which files are CGI programs?
<P>With some servers you have to configure the server to recognise executable
files.  For instance with Apache, one uses the AddHandler directive to say
that a filename extension should be treated as a CGI script.  For example
"AddHandler cgi-script .cgi".
<P>Xitami, in contrast, will execute anything it considers executable and
which is in a CGI binary directory. Special directives are not needed. Under
Windows, files with extension .exe or .com or .bat are executable by
default. Otherwise, files that start with #! and the name of an interpreter
are executable through the interpreter (typical example: Perl scripts).
Otherwise, files starting with the magic letters 'MZ' are also considered to
be executable. Under Unix, executable files are de-facto marked by a
protection bit, which makes things a lot simpler.
<P>You can add support for special kinds of CGIs by using the [Filter]
configuration section: this allows you to execute a file by passing it to
some interpreter.

.FAQ c How do I debug CGI programs?
<P>In many cases you can run the CGI program from the command-line,
providing test data to the program using the '<' redirector. It's also
possible to use a debugger. For example, under Windows I use the MSVC
compiler for C CGI programs. To set a debug breakpoint I insert a call to
DebugBreak() at some appropriate point in the program. This launches the
debugger and I can then step through the code. If you use this technique, be
sure to set the cgi:timeout high enough so that Xitami does not think your
CGI program has started to loop (it will then kill the process, and leave
you with a very confused debugger).

.FAQ c Can you give me a checklist for installing Perl for Windows?
<P>Okay, here goes:
<OL>
<LI>This applies to Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98.
<LI>Get Perl for Windows from $(*perl=activestate.com).
<LI>Follow the installation instructions and install into a directory like
C:\software\perl.
<LI>Using the above example, make sure that the PATH setting in your
autoexec.bat includes the directory C:\software\perl\bin.
<LI>Also, make sure that the PERLLIB environment variable is set in your
autoexec.bat to 'PERLLIB=.;C:\software\perl\lib'.
<LI>Reboot, then go to the Xitami cgi-bin directory and try 'perl
testperl.pl'.  This should print 'Hello World'.
<LI>Now make sure that the CGI scripts you want to run start with the magic
line '#! perl', or '#! /usr/bin/perl' or '#! C:/Software/perl/bin/perl' or
something else appropriate.
</OL>

.FAQ c Why does my Perl CGI not run?
<P>This is a check list that may help you.
<OL>
<LI>Did you install Perl?  (Yes, some people do forget this.)
<LI>Can you run the CGI script from the DOS command line using the syntax
'perl <I>scriptname</I>'?
<LI>Can you run the standard http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi program?
<LI>Can you run a simple script like this:
<PRE>#! perl
print "Hello World!";
</PRE>
<LI>Does your CGI script start with '#! perl'?
<LI>If you're running a 16-bit Perl, make sure Xitami is not in a subdirectory
with long filenames (E.g. C:\Program Files\Xitami) or the CGI won't work.
Under NT, forget 16-bit Perls completely.
<LI>Finally, set the cgi:debug and server:debug options to 1. This will
leave you with a couple of files in the temp directory- tempxxxx.cgo and
header.log - that contain the actual CGI output and the headers sent back to
the browser.
</OL>

.FAQ c How can I find-out what directory a script is called from?
<P>Here's a handy Perl snippet. It will dump the values of all environment
variables. Use it after you have output the usual http/html document
headers.
<PRE>print map("&lt;pre&gt;$_ = $ENV{$_}\n&lt;/pre&gt;", sort keys %ENV);
</PRE>
You'll find the values quite instructional, and you may even find a
variable that you can use to solve your problem.

.FAQ c Can I restrict the commands that a Perl CGI uses?
<P>This question was posed to Gurusami Sarathy, and he most graciously
offered the following reply:
<P>"The answer should be simple: just don't use Windows 95 if you want
security. I'd recommend some OS that understands users, permissions, etc.
Try Linux (I won't recommend NT, because NT makes for a rather inefficient
webserver).  That said, you may be able to disallow operators of your
choosing with the Safe module. But its usage is not for inexperienced
users."

.FAQ c Every time my SSI page uses #exec, Xitami scans the floppy drive!
<P>This can be caused by virus-checking programs.  Disable floppy scans in
the virus-checker setup and check that the A: drive is not in your path.

.FAQ c When I try to run a Perl CGI, my browser says 'Save to disk?'
<P>You must let Xitami know that the script is executable, rather than a
text file to be sent to the browser.  Make sure the script starts with
the magic '#! perl' line.

.FAQ c A require() or use() command in my Perl CGI script fails
<P>This is a problem caused by the working directory used by the Perl
interpreter.  First-off, make sure the CGI working directory is "-" (which
means the script's current working directory).  If this still does not work,
you have to modify the CGI script to explicitly set the correct working
directory.  Issue the following command, once, near the beginning of the
main Perl function and be any "require()" or "use()" commands:
<PRE>chdir ("c:/Xitami/cgi-bin/my_perl_script_dir");
</PRE>
<P>Use an absolute path, and substitute your own path, of course.

.FAQ c I get "Can't locate ./lib/cgi-lib.pl in @INC at C:\Program
Files\Xitami\cgi-bin\test\hello.cgi line 3."
<P>You have probably a problem with the PERLLIB setting.  It must include
the directories where require'd files are found.  Alternatively, you may be
able to fix this by running the script in the correct directory (set the CGI
workdir to "-").  To sort this problem out, make a CGI script that creates a
small file, then look for the file (this tells you where the script is
running).  E.g.:
<PRE>open (FILE, ">myhint");
print FILE "This is my working directory";
close (FILE);
</PRE>

.FAQ c I get "Document contains no data" when running a Perl CGI
<P>This message generally means "the Perl script didn't compile", which
in turn means there was a bug in your script.  Two things that might help:
<OL>
<LI> If you're using CGI.pm (recommended for Perl CGI scripts) then try
running it from the command line (CGI.pm will prompt for the script input,
which is very handy).
<LI>When you've run the CGI script, have a look in the Xitami cgi error log,
which is cgierr.log by default. If your script fails to compile, then you'll
get error messages here.
</OL>
You can also try putting "warn" messages in your Perl script, eg:
<PRE>warn "About to try ... \n";
</PRE>
and they'll appear in the CGI error log, so long as the script compiles and
runs up to that line.

.FAQ c How does Xitami handle its CGI stdio?
<P>Xitami creates temporary files called 'pipe' something, and connects
these to the stdin and stdout streams for the CGI subprocess. If there is
something crooked in the subprocess itself, these can get lost. For instance
if it's a 16-bit program under NT. The CGI_STDIN and CGI_STDOUT environment
variables are provided for languages like BASIC which really can't access
the stdio. Then it's possible to switch-off Xitami's piping (set cgi:stdio
to 0), and in the program, read and write the stdin and stdout files
directly.

.FAQ c Why does my Perl 'flush' command not work under Xitami?
<P>This command is a simple "$| = 1;" issued somewhere at the beginning of
the script, and is supposed to send (flush) to the browser any and all
output (print statements) as they are being issued. Because Xitami does not
work with streaming output, for now. It buffers all CGI output until the CGI
ends, then sends it to the browser. We're considering alternatives to this
model to allow streaming output.

.FAQ c My BASIC .exe CGI does not work
<P>Some languages do not write their output to the stdout device, but
directly to the BIOS. Try 'myprog > xxx' and if the output is still being
sent to the screen, consult your documentation. At a pinch, use the
CGI_STDOUT environment variable to determine the name of the expected output
file, and write directly to that file. If you do this, makes sure you set
cgi:stdio to 0.

.FAQ c Why do I get 'HTTP/1.0 502: Service temporarily overloaded'?
<P>Increase the cgi:timeout value. Your CGI is taking so long that Xitami
reckons it's looping with intent, and kills it (after giving it the
customary fair trial, of course). ('Looping with intent' is a Legal Term
that means almost exactly, but not quite totally, the opposite.)

.FAQ c Why is the REMOTE_USER not correctly filled-in?
<P>Make sure your directory is password-protected.  You can put the CGI
script at any level under a directory like 'private', so long as the URL
contains '/cgi-bin' somewhere.  If you access a CGI without an
authentication check, the REMOTE_USER will contain arbitrary junk; typically
the last user id that was used to access a protected resource.

.FAQ c Why is the HTTP_REFERER not correctly filled-in?
<P>Variables starting with HTTP_ come from the browser (unless you changed
something you were not supposed to).  For instance, the browser will usually
provide its own name rank and serial number in 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'.
HTTP_REFERER is filled-in if you choose a URL from another page, but not if
you type it by hand.

.FAQ c When I generate images in my CGI program, LF becomes CRLF!
<P>By default the stdout for a program is handled as a text stream.  This
is easy to change.  First write the HTTP header, then (in C):
<PRE>setmode (fileno (stdout), O_BINARY);
</PRE>
In Perl, this should work:
<PRE>open (BLOCK, '>'.$ENV {'CGI_STDOUT'});
binmode BLOCK;
print BLOCK $binbuffer;
close BLOCK;
</PRE>

.FAQ c Must I use /cgi-bin in CGI URLs?
<P>You can redefine this by changing the server:cgi-url option. As
usual, modify this in defaults.cfg, not xitami.cfg.

.FAQ c I want to put some CGIs in another directory, e.g. /htdocs/myscripts
<P>Define a $(*config_cgi_alias=CGI alias).

.FAQ c How do I use a CGI program as a default page?
<OL>
<LI>Add the index.cgi file to the list of default pages.
<LI>Make sure that index.cgi is 'executable'.
<LI>Define the server:cgi-url as "/".
<LI>Define the server:cgi-bin directory to be same as server:webpages.
<LI>Define cgi:mixed-url to be 1.
<LI>Define cgi:dirlist to be 1 if you want directory listings to be enabled.
</OL>

.FAQ c How do I set-up a web site counter?
<P>Use a web site counter like
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/6742">this one for
Windows 95</A>.

.FAQ c How do I make a CGI file executable for DOS?
<P>There is no equivalent to the UNIX 'chmod' command under DOS/Windows.
After considering various techniques (e.g. looking at the extension), we
decided that the UNIX execve technique was the simplest; i.e. the script
specifies what interpreter to use. Actually if you want to see the code that
decides this, look at the SFL code in sflfile.c -- file_is_executable ().
The UNIX technique works for Perl, Awk and presumably shell scripts, and
with a little tweaking, for Rexx too. Finally, we take a peek at the file
contents if necessary. Under MS-DOS & Windows, a real executable starts with
'MZ'. That's sufficient for Xitami to try to run the thing. Conclusion:
executable files can take any extension and work with pretty much any
processor/interpreter.

.FAQ c I tried compiling testcgi.c but it wants sfl.h?
<P>The example CGI programs in C use the iMatix SFL library.  This is
included in the Xitami source kit (since Xitami also uses it).  You can
<A HREF="http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl">download it</A> from our site.

.FAQ c How do I use an URL like '/cgi/script'?
<P>You can set this option in the [Server] section of custom.cfg, in
the cgi-url option. Try this:
<PRE>[Server]
    cgi-url=/cgi
</PRE>

.FAQ c My CGI '/somedir/cgi-bin/script' does not work
<P>If you use /cgi-bin in the URL below the top level, you must enable the
cgi:wildcard option.

.FAQ c Can I redirect users to different pages using the .aut file?
<P>No, not without CGI programming. But it's quite simple to do in Perl or
C: you test the user name (forget the password - it's already been
validated) and return a header that redirects the browser to the actual
page: "Location: /somedir/somefile.htm". Use the environment variable
REMOTE_USER, which contains the user id.

.FAQ c Can I trap the user id to subset data?
<P>In a CGI you can use the user name to subset data: you could issue a
redirection to the appropriate file, e.g: Location: filename.htm depending
on the value of the REMOTE_USER environment variable, or use this variable
to determine what data to read from a database.

.FAQ c I want to limit CGIs, but not HTML pages, to certain IP addresses
<P>Add this to the authentication file:
<PRE>[/cgi-bin]
    webmask=..whatever...
</PRE>

.FAQ c How do I allow CGIs in any regular HTML directory?
<P>Set the server:cgi-url option to "/", and the server:cgi-bin option to
the same as the server:webpages option. Make sure cgi:mixed-url is 1.

.FAQ c How do I write a shopping-card CGI program?
<P>You should ask this kind of question on CGI or HTTP newsgroups, and
research the Internet for answers. The simplest way to do this is to use
cookies, or to use URL arguments (?xxxx) to know the 'state' for each user.
If you want to maintain long-term state for users, it's best to force them
to logon (and thus identify themselves) each time they come back to the
site.  See the question on $(*user_authentication=CGI user authentication).

.FAQ c How do I access ODBC databases under Windows?
<P>From Perl, you can use Win32::ODBC, ActivePerl for Win95, and the DCOM
driver. One report: "It worked very well - I was able to duplicate in a
matter of hours what my buddy took almost a week to do with MS software, and
the result was faster and looks better!"

.FAQ c My CGI program can't connect to ODBC under Windows NT; it works -
from the command line
<P>Under NT, each login ID has its own set of ODBC definitions. The reason
your program works from the command line is that it runs under your current
login ID, which apparently has a proper ODBC definition to utilize. The
Xitami web server runs as an NT service and does not use your login ID by
default. Xitami and all CGI programs launched from within it assume the
login ID assigned to Xitami at start up. This can either be a system ID,
which is typical, or a specified user ID, which requires extra configuration
by an NT administrator.
<P>The solution is to have an NT login created specifically for Xitami. It
need only have the standard User privileges (assuming your NT environment
uses the default definition of "User"). After this login is established, one
must use it to login and then define a proper ODBC connection. Next, Xitami
must be made to start as NT service using this new login instead of a system
ID. Since this new login ID does not (or at least should not) have
administrative rights, one will have to logout and log back in as an
administrator to change this setting, which is made from the Services
component of the Control Panel. Now when CGI programs run, they will do so
under the new login ID, and will consequently have access to the new ODBC
definition.

.FAQ c When I run a heavy ODBC CGI program, I get "Server Overloaded"
<P>Your problem is that the CGI program runs 'too long' and is then
killed by Xitami.  Increase the CGI timeout (which is specified in
seconds).

.FAQ c My images don't load when my CGI uses extra PATH_INFO
<P>When you run a CGI that contains extra path information (the PATH_INFO
environment variable), images on pages generated by the CGI will fail to
load if they're referred-to by relative URLs.  For example, if the CGI URL
is http://my_domain/cgi-bin/my_prog.cgi/extra-blah, and you refer to an
image "pic.gif", the browser will ask for a URL called:
http://my_domain/cgi-bin/my_prog.cgi/extra-blah/pic.gif, which presumably
won't work.  You can check this by enabling server debugging and looking at
debug.log.  There are two solutions:
<OL>
<LI>Use absolute references for the image files (starting with '/').
<LI>Add a BASE tag at the start of the page (after the HEAD tag):
<PRE>&lt;BASE href="http://my-domain/cgi-bin/"&gt;
</PRE>
</OL>

.FAQ c How do I do file uploads through CGI?
<P>Find the Internet document RFC1867. This is the kind of FORM code you
need:
<PRE>&lt;FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&gt;
File to process: &lt;INPUT NAME="userfile1" TYPE="file"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</PRE>
You can test this quite simply by using ACTION="cgi-bin/testcgi.exe" and
enabling CGI debugging ([cgi]debug=1) to see what the stdin stream looks
like. To decode the file upload data you could use the functions in
sflhttp.c.
<P>Form-based file uploads do not work in IE3.x and earlier, and we have
reports that it fails with some IE4 configurations.  Netscape 3.x and later
work fine.  Opera 3.x does not handle this.  Therefore, we recommend that
you use this carefully and probably best within an intranet setting where
you can be sure of the type and version of browser used.

.FAQ c My SSI page says '#exec command not permitted for security reasons'
<P>To enable the #exec command, set the ssi:exec option.

.FAQ c Can I use Java servlets with Xitami?
<P>Takyiu Liu says: I have used servlets with Xitami with an unconventional
way. I use servletrunner (or Jrun if you prefer a 3rd party servlet engine)
and point it to the servlet classes I have written (I have the servlet
connected to a SQL Anywhere DB on request). I then use Xitami to serve the
web pages, with form actions pointing at something like:
<PRE>&lt;FORM ACTION="http://53pc2951:8000/servlet/DBQuery" METHOD="POST"&gt;
</PRE>
On any platform where the servletrunner is not available, one can use the
(undocumented) approach:
<PRE>java sun.servlet.http.HttpServer -d your_servlet_directory
</PRE>
In other words, so long as a platform has a JDK 1.1 JVM, you can run servlets
with just a copy of jsdk.jar.
<P>Jrun is meant to be a servlet engine but in 2.2 they added primitive http
support.  By default, it comes up on port 8000 and a typical location to put
the web pages is:
<PRE>\Program Files\Live Software\JRun\2.2\jsm-default\services\jws\htdocs
</PRE>
I think it is modelled after Sun's Java Web Server.  The default path for the
servlet classes is:
<PRE>\Program Files\Live Software\JRun\2.2\jsm-default\services\jse\servlets.
</PRE>I also believe Jrun's http capability comes from ACME's server API, and
so is very primitive compared with Xitami.  It is great to be able to combine
Xitami's http capability and Jrun (or servletrunner)'s servlet capability.

.FAQ c Can I use LRWP peers with another web server?
<P>You can use the sneaky parallel-server approach suggested by Takyiu Liu
for running servlets: run Xitami beside the other web server on another port,
just for the benefit of LRWP.

.FAQ c What plans do you have for server-side JavaScript?
<P>Xitami does not support server-size JavaScript and we do not have such
plans.

.FAQ c I've discovered a limit of 252 LRWP servers under Unix
<P>This is a problem with some Unix systems, caused by a limit on the number
of open file handles. You can link Xitami with AT&T's "SFIO" library
(available from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/sfio/ ). No source
modification is required: just copy libstdio.a and libsfio.a from the SFIO
distribution to ./src/smt/ and modify one line in "./src/smt/c" script from:
<PRE>LIBLIST="$LIBLIST $CCLIBS"
</PRE>
to
<PRE>LIBLIST="$LIBLIST $CCLIBS libstdio.a libsfio.a"
</PRE>

.build anchor user_authentication
.FAQ c How do I do user authentication in a CGI script?
<P>When a browser requests a page which Xitami considers 'protected', i.e.
which is defined in defaults.aut, it fills-in a request header like like
this:
<PRE>Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6MTIzNDU2Nzg=
</PRE>
<P>The strange thing at the end is the sequence "username:password" encoded
using base-64, as defined in the Basic Authentication Scheme in RFC2068.
Xitami provides the encoded string in the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION environment
variable.  You can decode this using a fairly simple function - see the SFL
sflmime module for an example in C.
<P>It's also possible to tell the browser to ask for a password, if none is
supplied, by generating a WWW-authenticate header.  For example:
<PRE>  if not VariableSet( HTTP_AUTHORIZATION )
    {
     HeaderLine( 'HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized' );
     HeaderLine( 'WWW-authenticate: basic realm="UserArea"' );
     echo 'Text to send if user hits Cancel button';
     exit;
    }
  else
     HeaderLine( 'Location: http://anHost/users/userCode/userPage.html' );
</PRE>
An entry like the following should exist in the defaults.aut file:
<PRE>[/users]
  realm="UserArea"
  UserName1="UserPassword1"
  UserName2="UserPassword2"
  ...
</PRE>

<H3>Multihosting/Virtual Hosting</H3>

.FAQH v What exactly do I need to define for a Virtual Host?
<P>For the main configuration you have xitami.cfg+defaults.cfg. For each
virtual host you have some XXXXX.cfg. For unresolved virtual hosts you have
basehost.cfg. Use the WBA virtual host wizard to define new virtual hosts.

.FAQ v How do I set-up a virtual host on another port?
<P>You can do this quite simply by starting two copies of Xitami. We do this
quite often; the advantage is that you can get the effect of multiple hosts
(different document roots) without playing with the DNS system. Otherwise,
you have to define DNS entries that map several different names
'www1.here.com', 'www2.here.com' to the same IP address, then base the
virtual hosting on the different names. Either way is okay; Xitami is so
small that running two or even a dozen copies will not stress a system.

.FAQ v How do I provide space for individual users on my system?
<P>Let's say you installed Xitami in c:\servers\xitami. Then, the main
webpage directory will be c:\servers\xitami\webpages. An URL like
'http://dynamic210.adelphia.net/Joe' is taken to mean something like:
'http://dynamic210.adelphia.net/Joe/index.htm', which would be a file:
'c:\servers\xitami\webpages\joe\index.htm'. You can also use
default.htm, and you can change the main webpages directory to be
somewhere else if you want. Under Windows 95 and NT you can make each
subdirectory shareable separately, so that users can update their pages
but not mess with other files.  You can also use aliases, especially if
users' pages are on different disks.

.FAQ v And how about their CGI scripts?
<P>Any URL containing /cgi-bin/ is treated as a CGI directory. So, Joe
can put his web pages in "c:\servers\xitami\webpages\joe\" and his CGI
programs in "c:\servers\xitami\webpages\joe\cgi-bin\".

.FAQ v Can I run two versions of Xitami, e.g. on ports 80 and 1010?
<P>It should work okay, providing you stop the two Xitami's from stepping on
each others toes (eg, different home directories). If you want to run on
port 1010 you'll have to give Xitami a carefully calculated base value (base
(1010-80)=930; 1080 would be easier (base 1000).

.FAQ v My virtual host setup does not work - what can I try?
<UL>
<LI>First off, if you're using DNS-based virtual hosting, understand that
this will only work with version 3 or later browsers.  If in doubt, enable
server debugging and check the request.log - each request must have the
correct Host: header field.
<LI>Then, check the debug.log file, which will show the virtual-host chosen
for each URL request.
<LI>If necessary, use the config-file debugging option to trace which config
files are loaded, and when.  Any line starting with '!' will be sent to the
debug.log file, if debugging is enabled.  For instance, add lines like this
to your VH config and authorisation files:
<PRE>! Loading somehost config
</PRE>
<LI>Check that your proxy is not playing games: it could be passing you
old pages despite the virtual host config.
</UL>

<H3>FTP Questions</H3>

.FAQH f People can't transfer files or see directories on my FTP server
<P>This is a typical problem caused by the way FTP works. If there is a
firewall (some some kinds of router are the same) which does not allow
connections from the server to the client, file transfers (including
directory listings) will fail. You should tell your users to use 'passive'
connections.

.FAQ f How do I use my D: drive for additional FTP space?
<P>You can move the entire FTP root anywhere you like - this is one way. You
can also define any number of FTP aliases, which point to different file
systems, CD-ROMs, etc. You can also put different FTP users' directories on
different disks. For instance if I log in to 'anonymous', you could set my
home directory to d:\anon\.

.FAQ f When exactly does Xitami read the FTP user file?
<P>Xitami reads this when it starts up, when you restart it, or after the
refresh timeout (30 seconds by default).

.FAQ f If I give a user only 'P' access to a directory they can't list it
<P>Normally you'd use 'P' by itself for a directory meant purely for
uploads. I.e. a userid 'uploads' with a dedicated write-only directory.
If you use 'P' by itself on a subdirectory, the user will not be able to
'cd' into it.

.FAQ f I'm having problems getting my FTP permissions right
<P>The FTP permissions definitions are quite complex and it's easy to get
these wrong.  The most common mistake is when you define directory-level
protections.  For instance, if the ftproot is in 'ftproot', and a user
'guest' connects to 'guest' (a subdirectory of ftproot), then how do you
specify the protection for a subdirectory 'guest/pub'?  The correct form is:
<PRE>[pub]
    guest=..flags..
</PRE>
and not [guest/pub], [/pub], [/guest/pub] or any other combination.  The key
is that you have to look at the protected directory name from the point of
view of the logged-on user.  The user's home directory is []; the pub
subdirectory is [pub].
<P>To debug this kind of problem, enable server debugging, then check
debug.log. It'll indicate the actual permissions that were used to access
the directory.  Make sure you read the comments in ftpdirs.aut to see how
FTP authentication works.

.FAQ f How do I create an alias under the /pub directory?
<P>This is not possible at present.

.FAQ f Helloftp.txt does not show up under web-based FTP access
<P>This depends entirely on your browser: some show it, some don't.

.FAQ f FTP aliases don't show-up when I do a browser directory listing
<P>Aliases don't show-up in HTTP directory listings.  They do show up in
FTP listings.  This is just the way things work.

.FAQ f How do I set-up FTP virtual hosts?
<P>Do this the same way as for normal HTTP virtual hosts.  Note that the
normal FTP protocol does not handle DNS-based virtual hosts.  Xitami, and
some FTP clients, allow this by using the convention 'user@hostname' during
the connection process.

.FAQ f Can I remotely browse my hard drives using Xitami?
<P>You can define an FTP alias to C:\, for instance, and manage this using a
remote FTP client. Make sure you use a secure user id and password.

<HR>
<H3>Log File Questions</H3>

.FAQH l How do I use the Xitami log files?
<P>There are many freeware and commercial logfile analysers; the Xitami
access logfiles are NCSA/HTTPd compatible and thus compatible with most
logfile analysers.  The Xitami.log file is used for server messages and
thus not suitable for analysis.

.FAQ l Does the FTP server log logins, uploads, and downloads?
<P>The FTP server logs uploads and downloads in the Xitami access log file,
by default.  To separate the FTP access log into a separate file, change
the Ftplog:filename configuration option.  This also applies to the error
log, specified by ftperrlog:filename.

.FAQ l Why does access.log contain only numeric addresses?
<P>You should configure and enable the reverse-DNS translation function.

.FAQ l Can I use Microsoft's WINS protocol for analysing my log files?
<P>Yes. This is extracted from Microsoft's documentation: "In Windows NT
4.0, Microsoft's implementation of DNS is tightly integrated with WINS. This
allows non-WINS clients to resolve NetBIOS names by querying a DNS server.
Administrators can now remove any static entries for Microsoft-based clients
in legacy DNS server zone files in favor of the dynamic WINS/DNS
integration. For example, if a non-Microsoft-based client wants to get to a
Web page on an HTTP server that is DHCP/WINS enabled, the client can query
the DNS server, the DNS server can query WINS and the name can be resolved
and returned to the client. Previous to the WINS integration, there was no
way to reliably resolve the name because of the dynamic IP addressing.
Please see the 'DNS and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0' white paper for details on
the WINS/DNS integration."  The upshot of this is that xixlat will work with
WINS if you have a WinNT 4.0 DNS server.

.FAQ l My log file has this strange URL: webpages/http://hostname/file.htm
<P>This is caused by the browser (usually MSIE4) sending a HTTP1/1 proxy
request.  Xitami can not (yet) handle these.  This usually indicates that
someone has defined your web server as a proxy server.

.FAQ l I can't access the log files while Xitami is writing to them!
<P>This is normal behaviour under Windows.  Under Unix and OS/2 you may
have more luck.

.FAQ l My log files do not get updated until Xitami is restarted
<P>This happens (on several operating systems) because the OS may not show
changes to a file until the file is closed by the process writing to it.
When you do a restart, Xitami closes its log files, and then you see all the
entries. At a guess the log files are being block buffered, which means that
they'll only be written out to the file once a block is full (probably
somewhere between 2K and 8K at a guess). This is a function of the way that
the runtime library handles file I/O.

.FAQ l My computer crashed and now my log files are full of junk
<P>When the computer crashes, for whatever reason, it can leave open files
in an incomplete state. One symptom is that allocated blocks can contain
garbage from previous files, allocated to the new file, but not yet written
with data.  This is probably what happened to your log file.  In other words,
the junk is probably not what caused the crash, just random data that
happened to be on the hard disk when Xitami was writing to its log file.

<HR>
<H3>Miscellaneous Questions</H3>

.FAQH m How do you pronounce Xitami?
<P>Just say 'iMatix' backwards -- it's simple! Okay, to be more precise...
There are two basic ways to pronounce this name; you can aspirate the 'X' as
'Sh', or you can keep it hard, as 'Ks'. In either case the accent is on the
second syllable.

.FAQ m What are the main problems with Xitami today?
<P>People also often ask for FrontPage support.  Besides the fact
that FrontPage uses an undocumented server interface, we think that if you
want to be tied to a single platform (Windows in this case) you can use the
platform-specific server (IIS in this case).  Xitami offers a long-term
approach, robust enough to survive several OS changes.

.FAQH m Can you recommend a search engine for Xitami?
<P>We've tried a few; there is a free engine available from <A
HREF="www.excite.com">www.excite.com</A>, and we've also tested the free
Swish engine, which works well with Xitami. You can get Wim Niemans' port of
this for Windows 95/98/NT from the $(*swish=iMatix website).

.FAQ m Why is the Xitami mailing list not a newsgroup?
<P>We are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages of newsgroups
vs. mailing lists.  Each has their strong points, but in general a mailing
list is accessible to more people than a newsgroup.  We're looking for ways
to provide transparent merging of the two techniques, so that people can
use the mailing list either as a newsgroup or a list.  Until that date,
we will stick with a mailing list.

.FAQ m Why do I get errors on 'robots.txt'?  What is this?
<P>The various search engines (like AltaVista) use a 'web spider' or 'robot'
to scan and index websites. This often includes large amounts of junk that
make the resulting searches pretty useless. So, a standard mechanism has
evolved to make this work better. The 'Robot Exclusion Standard' specifies
that a file called 'robots.txt' in the home directory will indicate which
pages or directories should be ignored. This is not meant as any kind of
security device, just a 'hint'. So, most robots will ask for this file. If
the errors in the log files bother you, create an empty file in the webpages
directory called 'robot.txt'.  To ask all robots to skip your site, use
this:
<PRE># robots.txt
User-Agent: *
Disallow: /
</PRE>

.FAQ m Can I customise the directory listings?
<P>No, not in this version.

.FAQ m Why is the password file not encrypted?
<P>In general if access to your server is secure, then the lack of
encryption is not a problem. If someone can read the Xitami directory on
your system, they can see the passwords. Note that even if you use a hashed
password file, it is often trivial to discover passwords using a
dictionary-based attack. It's therefore much better to concentrate on hiding
the password file than on encrypting it.  At some future date, Xitami will
support encrypted (hashed) passwords.

.FAQ m Do I need a special license to use/sell/modify Xitami at work?
<P>No, none.  Read the $(*license=Xitami_license).

.FAQ m I want to write a great Xitami addon...
<P>Excellent news!  Xitami is an Open Source project, and has benefitted
from many contributions, including people who ported the SFL library, wrote
plugs like the LRWP agent, wrote documentation, tested it, and so on.  You
will want to learn how to use our great tools - Libero, SFL, SMT.

.FAQ m How do I rebuild the SFL under Windows using MSVC?
<P>The simplest check-list is:
<OL>
<LI>Get the Xitami Windows source code distribution (this always contains
the most recent release of SFL).
<LI>Unzip into a directory; the SFL source code is put into src\sfl.
<LI>Create a new project, for a static library; change the options to
create an output file in the main directory (instead of debug/). I usually
call the library 'libsfl.lib'.
<LI>Add all source files called 'sfl*.c' from the src/sfl directory.
<LI>Build.
</OL>
For SMT, you can do the same, but there are some sources you want to leave
out: smttst*.c and smtschm.c.

.FAQ m I'm building a Windows app based on Xitami, but it aborts
<P>If you try to mix Xitami with MFC, you'll get a server that stops running
after 60 seconds, or whatever you set the server:refresh interval to. This
is because MFC traps the timer signal Xitami uses, and handles it as an
abort. There may be workarounds for this, depending on how well you know
MFC.

.FAQ m How do I rebuild Xitami under Windows using lcc-win32?
<P>If you want to compile under Windows, you should download the Windows
source kit, not the Unix one - this will give you files with the correct
line endings (CRLF not LF). Then, you should set the environment variable
CCNAME to lcc and CCDIR to the lcc-win32 directory. Try the c.bat file on
one source, e.g. sflbits to make sure it works correctly, then run build.bat
in src/sfl. Copy sfl.h and libsfl.lib to src/smt, and run build.bat there
too. Lastly, when Xitami is built, be prepared to throw it away, since at
the time of writing, lcc-win32 had a bug which causes Xitami to halt when it
gets a timer signal -- see the following question.

.FAQ m I compiled Xitami with lcc-win32 but it always aborts
<P>Lcc is a wonderful little compiler but its runtime has a problem with
certain interrupts. Basically, when Xitami receives a timer signal, it
aborts. This hits after the refresh timeout, and when running CGIs. We have
notified the author of lcc, and provided a small test program that shows
this behaviour. It's quite clearly a bug in lcc. Apart from this problem,
we've found lcc to be fast, reliable, and in fact it's supported fully by
the SFL. I can recommend it for CGI programming (oh, one more caveat - no
support for ODBC as far as I could see).

.FAQ m Why are there bugs in Xitami?
<P>Any complex software is filled with bugs. Xitami is pretty good in this
respect, we reckon. Our policy is to fix those we can identify and localise,
depending on the severity of the problem. A bug that causes the server to
crash will make us run around a lot faster than a bug which causes some
obscure feature to work otherwise than documented.  Large amounts of money
will also tend to focus our attention.

.FAQ m Why is Xitami free, and will it remain this way?
<P>Xitami is a product that we developed to demonstrate the quality of our
technology and to introduce people to iMatix Corporation.  This web server
will remain free software, and as the kernel for our commercial web server
products, will continue to be ported, improved, and maintained.

.FAQ m Where can I get older versions of Xitami?
<P>We keep one back version but not older ones.  You may be able to find
a specific version by searching through an FTP search engine like the
one at http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no.

.FAQ m Do you have any plans to incorporate SSL into Xitami?
<P>Xitami/Pro supports this.  E-mail us for details and prices.

.FAQ m What is the future for Xitami?
<P>Xitami will continue to be improved and extended, while keeping it a
server that you can install and set-up within minutes.  For professional
users, Xitami/Pro offers more sophisticated functions but these also take
more time to learn and configure.  Xitami will remain free software.

.FAQ m Is Xitami year 2000 compatible?
<P>Yes.

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>The Dream</H3>

<P>Xitami was never meant to be the world success it is today.  Heck, we
released version 1.0 just to demonstrate how internet servers *should* be
written.  Unfortunately for our private lives, a screaming horde of people
dragged poor little Xitami out of the door, into the bright light of day,
and insisted that we beat it into the shape of a real web server.

<P>Let's make it clear: the main motivating forces behind Xitami (at least
as far as our team was concerned) were laziness and hubris. Larry Wall got
this exactly right.  Frankly, we were too lazy to install Apache, and
arrogant enough to think we could do better than Microsoft on their own
systems.

<P>From the first release of Xitami, the majority of changes, improvements,
and fixes were provoked by its users.  Xitami consists of a small group of
programmers surrounded by hundreds of vocal, and supportive users.  It's a
great mix.

<P>Our dream was to show the world that large, slow, and complex software
is a deception.  Xitami does its job with a minimalistic grace, smoothly
directing the traffic streaming through its arms.  No waste, no haste.
Where other servers are traffic lights, Xitami is a round-about.

<H3>The Machine</H3>

<P>We built Xitami from the ground-up using an approach that should delight
any student of engineering, software or otherwise. First step - ask the
question: 'what are the real problems a web server has to solve?'. Step two
- answer these problems. The real problems are, as far as we could see,
ease of use, performance, stability, and portability. Basically, we wanted
something that would install in a minute, always run fast, never crash, and
run on every machine on our rather mixed-up network.  This is what we made,
more or less.  In some situations, Xitami does crash, but it's quite rare.

<P>A perfectionist design like this can't succeed without some kind of
discipline and formality.  This is one of the basic debates in programming.
Is programming a science or an art?  Do you use a free-wheeling, organic
approach, or an organised, formalised approach?  This is like the debate
about heredity against environment.  You need both to succeed.  Xitami was
built using a tightly-defined method, but allowing any and all creativity
on top of that.

<P>To write a Xitami agent, like the LRWP agent that Robin Dunn wrote in
1997, you need to learn: the C programming language, the Libero tool, the
SFL library, the SMT kernel, and something about the HTTP protocol.  This
is a fair challenge.  However, when you've absorbed this knowledge, the
program you write runs on Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2, Linux, and just
about every other modern machine out there.  For a programmer, being able
to write a truly portable program is akin to the promise of immortality.
Certainly it drives thousands to learn languages like Java, putting-up with
all the problems that young languages bring with them.

<P>Xitami will run on every capable machine in existence for the next
fifty years without significant difficulty at all.

<P>A day will come when the use of C will look dated. For a long time we
built tools using COBOL 74, a language that does not know about pointers,
and dynamic allocation, or even lowercase letters. The tools we built were
excellent, widely-used, and long-lasting. Linked-lists, recursive
algorithms, virtual memory management, we did all of this in a language
designed for writing accounting systems. This taught us that the choice of
language is not as important as people often believe. But it can make your
life easier or harder, and you can't produce better code than the compiler
generates. Some COBOL compilers are attrociously bad.  On the AS/400, the
generated code for a statement like 'ADD 1 TO A' consists of about ten
instructions: take A, convert to floating point, take 1, convert to
floating point, add to A, round the result to N digits, convert from
floating point, store back in A.  The machine supports an instruction
'increment' which would do the job in one step.

<P>Most operating systems are written in C, and on modern systems, the C
compiler is the most stable, optimised, and standardised available.  This
is borne-out by our experience: we have found very few compiler errors
despite running Xitami on a couple of dozen different C compilers.

<P>If you look at the sources for Xitami, you'll see various references to
something called 'Libero'.  This simple but magical tool is our most
elementary weapon in the battle to render complex problems simple.  Libero
is not dedicated to any single type of work - it's been used in many
different domains.  When it comes to writing an Internet server, however,
it's hard to imagine a better start.

<P>There is a handy trick that you can use to understand and describe
certain kinds of system.  Let's call this 'an event-driven approach'.
Many problems (including many types of program) suddenly become much easier
to understand and describe when you look at them in this way.  It's just a
trick, because of course the real problem is unchanged.  But a good
programmer, being lazy, will use any trick that makes life easier.  In a
classic program, the programmer says 'okay, we do this, then this, then
that'.  In an event-driven program, one says 'when this happens, do that.
When that happens, do thus'.  It's strange at first, but quickly makes
sense.  Libero takes this approach and turns it into actual code.  Suddenly
we have a way to describe complex systems <I>and</I> produce the code that
makes them work.  In the same breath.

<P>By exceedingly good chance, servers, including web servers, fall smack
bang into this category of problem.  When you look at the Libero
description of the Xitami web service, you see on a couple of pages the
complete logic of a web server.  This is stunningly simple compared to
trying to read the Apache source code.

<P>The main technical challenge behind any web server, however it's
written, is performance. Writing a program that will answer one HTTP
request is almost trivial. Writing a program that can answer several
hundred in a few seconds is something else. Most existing web servers have
tried to evolve from the first case to the second. Under Unix, they start
dozens or hundreds of processes. Under Windows, they start dozens or
hundreds of threads. Either way, each process or thread handles one single
user request. The Windows threads approach is fast, but totally specific to
one operating system. The Unix process approach is fast once it's started.
But it takes ages to start and stop a server like this, and the web server
inevitably takes over the entire system. There are 'portable' thread
libraries, but frankly: writing real multi-threading code is like walking
on eggshells.  We're too lazy to learn to do this.

<P>The basic problem with a web server is that you have to handle many
short-lived connections. When the cost of creating and eventually killing a
process or thread is significant compared to the cost of handling the
request, the server is not efficient.

<P>Building on Libero's event-driven approach, we built a solution to this
problem, with the catchy name 'SMT'. SMT dispenses with all the stress of
creating processes and threads by handling everything in one single
process. We call this 'multi-threading', but that's marketing. In fact SMT
enforces an event-driven model onto the programs, and simulates a kind of
event-driven thread. It's like writing Quicksort algorithms in COBOL. You
don't need recursion built-in to the language to implement a recursive
algorithm. Bizarrely enough, simulated recursion is often faster than the
real thing. The same thing goes for SMT's event-driven threads. An SMT
thread needs none of the adminstrative baggage of a normal multi-threaded
program - locks, semaphores, and so on. It just handles the events it gets
in its queue, and sends out events to other threads. A thread always runs
exclusively, with SMT switching to another thread only between the major
steps of the Libero 'dialog'.

<P>SMT seems to be a perfect approach for Internet servers of all kinds. If
there are flaws in it, we've not seen them yet. 

<P>It's pretty pointless building the perfect web server if it only runs on
one operating system. This is like writing haiku in sand on the beach. The
point of software, like art, is to reach a public. Unfortunately, the
public for software is a moving target. Operating systems last a few years,
and non-portable software dies with them when they go. There are different
tactics to portability. Microsoft try 'portability by exclusion'. If
everyone runs Windows, portability is easier (ignoring that new version of
Windows coming up fast behind you). Java and Posix define 'portability by
decree'. Presumably in the hope that people like Microsoft will tamely go
along with the idea. Many projects do 'portability by patching', which
means patching the software each time it is ported, leading to masses of
'#ifdefs' throughout the programs.

<P>At iMatix, we chose 'portability by paranoia'. A library, the SFL,
provides all the functions our programs need that are not 100% portable. A
program that uses SFL correctly is fully portable. The approach works
because we're not dependent on the goodwill of other people. If some
operating system decides to implement sockets in some bizarre way, we just
add support in SFL. Xitami's portability is the flying carpet that takes it
into the future.

<P>Of course, we cheated a couple of times.  To run Xitami under Windows,
we built a native Windows console program that lets a user manage the
server.  It's not portable, but it does turn Xitami into a neat little
Windows program.  Apart from that, the entire Xitami source code is
fully portable.

<H3>Thanks</H3>

<P>The Xitami team itself consists of Pascal Antonnaux, Ewen McNeill,
Jonathan Schultz, with Pieter Hintjens doing the co-ordination and
production.  The Xitami team has been working together since the first
release of Xitami, in January 1997.

<P>Thanks to the folk at iMatix for providing technical support, coffee,
and most of the finance for this project.  iMatix does not make a profit on 
Xitami, but it's become a kind of company mascot.

<P>Providing the first buffer between ourselves and our users is the Xitami
discussion list. This is run by Scott Drake, who took over in October 1997
when the original list, run by Martyn Drake (no relation), lost its home.
We owe a great deal to Scott, and his company, isonline.com.  Thanks also
to Ewen McNeill for his clear and concise answers to many hundreds of
questions on the list, and the many other people who have contributed
information to the list.

<P>We were lucky to find ourselves surrounded by a number of people, Xitami
users with apparently infinite patience and tolerance for disasters, who
adopted Xitami and regularly send us their comments and ideas. Some of
these have built ISP businesses using Xitami, others use Xitami in their
companies. Thanks to Ben Tremblay, Bruce Walter, Fabian Bess, Glenn
Williams, Ignacio Bustamente, James Beasley, Jayson Minard, Jeff Wolkove,
Jimi Joergensen, Josh Lydolph, Istvan Kovacs, Leif Svalgaard, Patrick
Bedert, Paul Richards, Peter D'Hoye, Rob Judd, Thomas Grobicki, Wim
Niemans, Dan, who's full name we never knew, and the many others who took
time to send us their ideas, comments, and bug reports.

<P>Thanks to Diego Antona, Wim Niemans, Robert White, and Taweewit Pensawat
for providing Xitami mirror sites.

<P>Thanks to DeXin and Chin Fang for providing an excellent home for Xitami
on imatix.com, and a big "thanks" to Jayson Minard of OpenAvenue.com for
giving a new home at OpenAvenue.com for xitami.com, finally allowing us to
run xitami.com on a Xitami server.

<P>Thanks to Mohammed Aziz and Rick Caccia of NetDynamics for including
Xitami in their NetDynamics package in early 1997, proving that Xitami was
up to scratch. As far as we know, Sun still includes Xitami in NetDynamics.

<P>Thanks to Dr Dobb's Journal (and especially Eugene Eric Kim) for
publishing our initial articles on Libero and Xitami.

<P>Thanks to Robin Dunn for writing the LRWP agent, a great piece of work,
and a great asset to Xitami, and to Scott Beasley for providing the mailto
program. Thanks to Thomas Schroeter for supporting and managing xitami.de,
the German Xitami site.  Since day one, about 8% of all Xitami users are
from Germany.

<P>Thanks to the several thousand of you who have emailed and registered,
telling us what you thought about Xitami, being liberal with your criticism
and compliments alike.

<P>Finally, thanks to the literally hundreds of thousands of people who use
Xitami every day without sending us emails.  We appreciate it more than you
know!

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Release Notes for Xitami 2.5</H3>

<P>These are the release notes for the latest major version of
Xitami, since the last release of the previous major release.
Summary release notes for every release since 1.0a come afterwards.

<UL>
<LI>Further support for HTTP/1.1, including partial GETs. We now consider
Xitami to be a HTTP/1.1 server, although a number of optional HTTP/1.1
features are not yet implemented. The critical features implemented are:
keep-alive handling, document publishing, resume (partial GET), and
HTTP/1.1 virtual hosts.

<LI>SSI handling is now done internally. To use SSI pages you no longer
need to install Perl and the perlssi filter. The Xitami installation still
includes perlssi, but it is not activated in the .cfg file [Fiilters]
section. The new [SSI] section controls the internal SSI agent. The most
important config items in this section are:
<TABLE BORDER=0><TR>
<TD>enabled=1/0</TD><TD>Enable or disable SSI, enabled by default</TD>
<TD>timeout=30</TD><TD>Timeout for CGI programs called from the SSI agent</TD>
<TD>exec=0</TD>Enable/disable the #exec command, a potential security hole.
The SSI_INSECURE environment variable is no longer used.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
To re-enable use of the perlssi filter, remove references to xixssi in
xitami.cfg, and add the [Filter] definition for perlssi.

<LI>Xitami's logging capabilties have been given a complete overhaul. The
new logging agent lets you manage log file rotation/cycling in many
different ways, and lets you create log files in many formats.
<P>The built-in log file formats are:
<UL>
<LI>CLF  - Common-log format, as used by the NCSA httpd server.
<LI>CLFX - Extended CLF, as used by Apache and Xitami.
<LI>MS   - Microsoft format as used by IIS.
<LI>LML  - iMatix Logfile Markup Language, an XML format.
<LI>XLML - iMatix Extended LML, a richer XML format.
</UL>
<P>LML and XLML are intended to simplify log-file post-processing via an
XML-capable tool like GSLgen. You can also define custom log file formats
using any combination of text, delimiters, and logging data fields.
<P>The logging agent performs reverse-DNS translations on the fly, note
that you must define the RDNS configuration before this will work.
<P>You can cycle log files hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. You can cycle
the log files when the server starts-up, when they exceed some size in
kilobytes, or when they exceed some size in lines.
<P>You can specify the exact day and/or time a log file must be cycled.
<P>When cycling a log file, you can rename the old file, delete the old
file, move the old file to some directory, append the old data to some
file, or run an arbitrary command against the old log file.
<P>You can decide how to name old log files using a mask built from the
current day, time, and other information or text.
<P>Each virtual host can have independent settings for its HTTP and FTP log
files.

<LI>A new 'supervisor agent' cleans-out old log files, temporary files,
etc. This agent can be activated on servers that must run for long periods
without manual intervention or monitoring. By default it is disabled - set
the [Server] supervisor option to 1 to enable it.

<LI>Xitami can now act as a dynamic-DNS registration client, so that if you
register with a service like Xitami.Net, Xitami does the necessary work to
register your IP address. Xitami works with several DDNS services, and it's
quite easy to add other ones once you know the protocol used. This is an
example of the [Ddns] section, set-up to use the Xitami.net service (we've
blanked-out the password key):
<PRE>[Ddns]
    Domain = "black.xitami.net"
    Enabled = "1"
    Password = "TZO-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
    Service = "tzo.com"
    Username = "admin@xitami.com"
</PRE>

<LI>The LRWP protocol handler has been upgraded to LRWP/2.0, which is a
more secure and faster version of the LRWP protocol. Xitami still handles
LRWP/1.0 applications.

<LI>ISAPI support is now available, for Windows systems, as an LRWP plug-
in. You can download this from xitami.com.

<LI>Java Servlet support is available, for all systems, as a LRWP plug-in.
You can download this from xitami.com.
  
<LI>Various other improvements to the HTTP service:
<UL>
<LI>You can issue customised HTTP headers depending on file types.
<LI>Aliases can now refer to a full filename, which provides an easy way to
define a default file for a certain URL.
<LI>CGI programs can now be started under specific user ids and user
groups. This can be defined on a virtual-host basis.
<LI>If the URL parameter is 'sort=xxx', uses this value instead of the
current server:dirsort option.
</UL>

<LI>Various other improvements to the FTP service:
<UL>
<LI>Xitami supports the FTP user@hostname syntax for virtual hosts. This
lets you construct FTP logins to access virtual hosts, and some FTP clients
support this directly.
<LI>Uploads can no longer exceed hard quota.
</UL>

<LI>Xitami now uses GSLgen in several important places. GSL is iMatix's
Open Source template-based code-generation language. The GSLgen engine is
built-in to Xitami, and GSLgen is also provided as a seperate command-line
tool with Xitami. GSL templates are called 'scripts' and are normally
placed in the gsl subdirectory. You can modify these, but we recommend
you copy them and change the copies. Each virtual host can use its own set
of scripts.
<UL>
<LI>Each script starts with a small explanation, which you will need when
you want to change them or make your own. Especially useful is the list of
data fields that you can insert into the template.
<LI>HTTP directory listings are no longer hard-coded, but are now based on
a script called httpdir.gsl. The script creates a page with three columns,
each resortable. This uses the new '?sort=xxx' feature.
<LI>FTP messages, such as that shown when the user logs-in, are based on a
template, rather than the previous set of static text files. This lets you
show messages like 'there are X users logged-in to this server'.
<LI>You will also find GSLgen useful for analysing and processing log files
in LML or XLML formats.
<LI>Xitami lets you process XML files directly into HTML, using GSL scripts.
This is a powerful way of showing data that comes from other sources.
</UL>

<LI>The Xitami config file, xitami.cfg, now contains full documentation for
all options. The config file is actually generated using GSLgen, from an
XML definition file. The same XML definition file generates various pieces
of source code, and the HTML documentation for the config file options.
This is an example of a useful GSL application.

<LI>A new package, the Xitami SDK, contains a number of tools and
components that were previously either not supplied or were dispersed in
other packages:
<UL>
<LI>The iMatix Studio form compilers fdlgen and fmlgen. These tools are
used to create the HTML forms used in the Xitami WBA. FDL is a form
definition language based on htmlpp, and FML is an embedded form-markup
language based on HTML comment tags. Fdlgen converts an FDL file into FML,
and fmlgen converts an FML file into C language defintions that can be
compiled. A web program displays such forms using the form i/o system
(formio.c), also provided. FDL and FML are described in the fdldoc.txt and
fmldoc.txt files. Using these tools you can create your own derivates of
the Xitami WBA, and you can add the form functions to LRWP applications
written in C. The Xitami SDK includes the FDL file used by the Xitami WBA.
<LI>The WSX resource compiler, wsxrc. This is a Perl script that compiles
image files and other resources into C include files, so that they can be
compiled into an executable. The Xitami WBA uses this technique to compile
icons and images into the Xitami server executable, making the WBA faster
and more robust (not depending on external files). Wsxrc can easily be
adapted to generating other languages. One possible future for this tool is
to produce XML, which can then be fed to a GSL script. The Xitami SDK
includes the Xitami WBA resource file (xiadmin.rc) and all image files used
in the WBA (GIF files).
<LI>The Xitami configuration definition and script, xiconfig.xml and
xiconfig.gsl. These are the single source for all Xitami config option
definitions.
<LI>The Xitami model definitions and script, ximodel.xml and ximodel.gsl.
These generate the various Xitami models (xitami, xilite, xipro,...) from a
single script. You can define your own models, including the agents you
want. You will need to compile and link the generated program. We use a GSL
script here to avoid copying code.

<LI>Xitami 2.5 introduces the notion of <EM>throttle pipes</EM>, a
technique for limiting the bandwidth consumed by a web or FTP site. A
throttle pipe has a specific upload and download bandwidth, and is shared
by a set of web sites, and FTP sites. If throttle pipes are used (by
default they are disabled), then all HTTP accesses for a virtual host share
one throttle pipe.  FTP accesses use a default throttle pipe, but
individual logins can use other throttle pipes.  So, if you have a 64kbps
line, you can define all web and ftp downloads to share one 32kbps pipe,
while a privileged FTP login might have access to a 64kbps pipe.  Xitami
comes with a standard set of pipe definitions, but you can add more if you
want to.

</UL>
