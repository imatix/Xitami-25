<H3><A NAME="TOC128">What is WSX?</A></H3>

<P>WSX is the Xitami equivalent of protocols like ASAPI, ISAPI, etc.  A WSX
program is always written as a multithreaded SMT agent, and is linked into
the server executable.  Unlike the xxAPI protocols, WSX agents are not
loaded at runtime from dynamic link libraries, but are bound into the Xitami
executable.  This is done mainly to keep things simple, but also because SMT
does not support dynamically-loaded agents.

<P>A WSX agent handles some specific type of URL, based on the name of the
URL. For example, Xitami comes with two standard WSX agents - xiadmin and
xierror - which handle URLs starting with "/admin" and "/error"
respectively.

<P>Writing WSX agents is not trivial, but it's worth it for certain kinds of
work.  If you want to write WSX agents, you should take a good look at the
SMT documentation, and study the standard WSX agents.  WSX is <EM>not</EM> a
'fast CGI' protocol.  A WSX agent is tightly-bound into the web server,
while a CGI program is most definitely not.  I'll summarise the differences
between a CGI program and a WSX agent:
<UL>
<LI>CGI programs are portable between web servers; WSX agents are a specific
Xitami plug-in.
<LI>If a CGI program crashes, the user gets a nice error message.  If a WSX
agent crashes, the server is probably dead.
<LI>CGI programs are single-threaded: each on-going request is handled by
a separate CGI process; a WSX agent can handle multiple requests at once,
in the same way as Xitami handles multiple connections at once.
<LI>CGI programs are usually written by people with functional knowledge
(by this, I mean they are developing some kind of business solution),
whereas a WSX agent is a highly technical solution.
<LI>WSX agents can be used to extend the web server's functionality in
entirely new directions.  For instance, you could implement protocols like
FastCGI using a WSX agent.  CGI cannot be used in this manner.
<LI>WSX agents must be written using the SMT toolkit (including ANSI C and
the Libero tool), while CGI programs can be written in a variety of
languages (C, Perl, server-side Java, Basic, Awk).
<LI>You can do things with CGIs (like accessing slow databases) that are not
acceptable in WSX agents.
</UL>

<P>A WSX agent talks to the web server (actually, the smthttp agent) using a
set of messages. When a user asks for a URL that matches WSX agent, smthttp
sends the agent a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message. The WSX agent processes
the request (which can be a HTTP GET or POST), and replies with a WSX_OK,
WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_BIN, WSX_MBIN, WSX_ERROR, WSX_REDIRECT, WSX_RESTART, or
WSX_KILL message.

<P>The WSX agent gets a bunch of things from the web server: the URL that
was asked for, any arguments, the current HTTP symbol table, and the posted
data, if any. In return, it provides either the HTML data to show (for
WSX_OK, WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_BIN, or WSX_MBIN), a HTTP error code (for
WSX_ERROR), a redirected URL (for WSX_REDIRECT), or nothing (for the other
messages).

<H3><A NAME="TOC129">Writing WSX Programs</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="TOC130">Single-threaded or Multithreaded?</A></H4>

<P>Like all SMT agents, a WSX agent is either single-threaded or
multithreaded. A single-threaded agent is simpler to write than a
multithreaded agent, but is more limited in what it can do. The two WSX
agents provided with Xitami are both single-threaded.  More complex WSX
agents, such as the xilrwp agent, are multithreaded.

<P>The main difference is this: a single-threaded agent can only handle one
request at a time.  A multithreaded agent can handle dozens or hundreds.
If the agent can answer a request with little work, a single-thread can
be sufficient.  If a request implies some 'slow' work, such as making a
connection to another process or computer, or sending some message to another
agent and waiting for a reply, a multithreaded agent is better.

<P>In terms of programming, a single-threaded agent needs to use some
specific SMT notation (such as setting the SINGLE_THREADED macro to TRUE)
and does not handle any thread context.  A multithreaded agent in contrast
works with a thread context block that contains all data for the thread.
You'll find details of this in the SMT documentation, as well as examples of
both types of agent in the SMT source code.  For example, smthttp itself is
a multithreaded agent, while smtsock is single-threaded.

<H4><A NAME="TOC131">Managing Session Context</A></H4>

<P>There are two broad classes of WSX agent: those which have to handle
session context, and those that do not.  Examples of agents that require
session context are:
<UL>
<LI>The xiadmin administration agent; it has to know which screen the user
was working in, and what they were doing.
<LI>An agent that implements some kind of multi-transaction form; i.e. a
form where the user can make changes and work with more than one exchange
step.
</UL>

<P>Examples of agents that do not require session context are:
<UL>
<LI>The xierror error simulation agent; each request is totally independent
of any previous request.
<LI>An agent that implements CGI or a similar stateless protocol.
<LI>An agent that satisfies any other kind of stateless request.
</UL>

<P>HTTP is often described as a 'stateless protocol', but there are in fact
several ways to implement state. We can define state as a set of variables
that the server (or the WSX agent) needs to distinguish one user from
another, and to tell what state the user was in. I generally call this the
'context' for a session. Context is necessary if you want a decent level of
security, complexity, and ease of use. One commonly-used way to implement
context is <EM>cookies</EM>. These have a bad press: cookies are too often
abused to keep track of users' activity on a website. Another method is to
encode the context in the URLs used in the form. For instance, each submit
button or URL will invoke the same URL, but with an argument (?xxx) that
contains the context data. This has several disadvantages: sensitive
information that should be kept internally on the server may be sent to the
browser; the HTML stream can become very large; and the arguments sent back
to the server can also become very large. It has an advantages too: there is
no need to save any kind of data in the server.

<P>My preferred technique is to save the context in allocated memory, and
then to encode a <EM>key</EM> in the URL, using the ?xxx technique.  When
the WSX agent receives the request, it checks whether the key is present and
valid, and if so, continues the session with that data.  If not, it can
choose to show an error screen or reinitialise the session.  The HTML stream
is not affected by the size of the context, since all that is transmitted is
the session context key.

<P>If you encode session in this way, you need to do a few things if you are
building a serious server:
<UL>
<LI>You have to ensure that the session context key is unique, of course.
<LI>You must either generate a new key for each session step, or add some
kind of step counter, to enable the server to tell if the user uses the
browser's Back action, and then tries to resubmit the form data.
<LI>You must clean-up contexts when the user ends a session (if it is
possible to determine this) or when the session has been inactive for a
certain time (which you can determine using SMTTIME alarm messages).
<LI>You may want to compress the context (there are functions in SFL to do
this kind of thing).
</UL>

<P>One troublesome problem is the browser Back action.  There is no way to
disable this, and HTTP/1.1 specifically states that there is no way to
change the behaviour of a browser's history (which is what this is).  The
problem arises because when a user uses the Back action, they can resubmit a
form that is no longer meaningful in the current context.  One solution that
we have used in this situation is to refresh the current form when we detect
that the user has a valid session key but an invalid 'step' (i.e. has used
the Back action).  Another solution is to simply redisplay the main form
when this happens.  In any case, it's worth educating the user -- if only
with a small message on the main form -- that the Back action is not a good
idea within these forms.

<H4><A NAME="TOC132">Messages From smthttp</A></H4>

<P>A WSX agent talks to smthttp. The protocol is strictly binary: smthttp
sends a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message to the agent; the agent processes
this and sends back a reply. Each request has exactly one reply.

<P>The smtmsg.h and smtmsg.c modules provide functions to send and decode
WSX messages (as well as all the other SMT messages). These macros are used
to send a message to a WSX agent. Normally only smthttp does this, but you
may want to chain WSX agents so that one sends messages to another:
<PRE>send_wsx_request (
    QID  *to,                       /*  Destination thread queue       */
    char *request_url,              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments,                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host,             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    char *filename,                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    char *post_data,                /*  POSTed data, if any            */
    word  symbols_size,             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data,             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size,              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data);             /*  HTTP config table data         */
);

send_wsx_reqbin (
    QID  *to,                       /*  Destination thread queue       */
    char *request_url,              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments,                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host,             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    word  post_size,                /*  POSTed data size               */
    char *filename,                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    byte *post_data,                /*  POSTed data                    */
    word  symbols_size,             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data,             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size,              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data);             /*  HTTP config table data         */
);
</PRE>

<P>The request URL is an alias used to indicate what URLs the WSX
processes.  You can use '/' to indicate all URLs for a website or virtual
host.

<P>The HTTP symbol table is prepared as for a CGI process. That is, it
contains the same CGI fields, and the HTTP header fields under the same
conditions. Symbol names are converted to uppercase, with hyphens replaced
by underlines. For instance, the 'Content-Type:' header value is held as a
symbol called 'CONTENT_TYPE'. This block is stored as a table of strings of
the format "name=value" and a single null. The table ends with a null string
(two nulls in a row). To convert this block back into a usable symbol table
you can use the SFL descr2symb() function (from sflsymb.c). To use this you
must first prepare a DESCR block (which holds the size and data in a single
structure) as follows:
<PRE>DESCR symbols;
SYMTAB *symtab;

symbols.size = request-> symbols_size;
symbols.data = request-> symbols_data;
symtab = descr2symb (&symbols);
</PRE>
See below for an explanation of how to get the 'request' structure used in
this example.

<P>The virtual_host field is NULL if the request was made to the default
host; if the request was made to a virtual host, this field contains the
name or ip address of the virtual host as defined in the main config file
under the [Virtual-Host] section.

<P>The post_data field contains the POSTed HTTP data, if any.  In some cases
this data may be placed in a temporary file; in this case the post_data
field contains '@<I>filename</I>'.  The WSX agent should read the data from
this file.  It does not need to delete the file: this is done by Xitami
automatically.

<P>This is the structure of a WSX request:
<PRE>typedef struct {
    char *request_url;              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments;                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host;             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    char *filename;                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    char *post_data;                /*  POSTed data, if any            */
    word  symbols_size;             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data;             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size;              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data;              /*  HTTP config table data         */
} struct_smt_wsx_request;

typedef struct_smt_wsx_request WSXREQ;
</PRE>

<P>To unpack a WSX_REQUEST message into this structure, use this function:
<PRE>int get_smt_wsx_request (byte *buffer, struct_smt_wsx_request *request);
</PRE>

<P>For example:
<PRE>struct_smt_wsx_request
    *request = NULL;               /*  Incoming smt_wsx request       */

/*  Decode the WSX request using this standard function call          */
get_smt_wsx_request (thread-> event-> body, &request);

if (request)
    the_next_event = ok_event;
else
  {
    /*  The request can only be null if there is no memory left       */
    send_wsx_error (&thread-> event-> sender, HTTP_RESPONSE_OVERLOADED);
    the_next_event = exception_event;
  }
</PRE>

<P>When you've finished with a request, you must deallocate it as follows:
<PRE>/*  We're finished with the request structure - deallocate it         */
free_smt_wsx_request (&request);
</PRE>

<P>This is the structure of a WSX binary request:
<PRE>typedef struct {
    char *request_url;              /*  URL for WSX request            */
    char *arguments;                /*  URL arguments, if any          */
    char *virtual_host;             /*  Virtual host, if any           */
    word  post_size;                /*  POSTed data size               */
    char *filename;                 /*  Physical filename for URL      */
    byte *post_data;                /*  POSTed data                    */
    word  symbols_size;             /*  HTTP symbol table size         */
    byte *symbols_data;             /*  HTTP symbol table data         */
    word  config_size;              /*  HTTP config table size         */
    byte *config_data;              /*  HTTP config table data         */
} struct_smt_wsx_request;
</PRE>

<P>To unpack a WSX_REQBIN message into this structure, use this function:
<PRE>int get_smt_wsx_reqbin (byte *buffer, struct_smt_wsx_request *request);
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="TOC133">Messages Back To smthttp</A></H4>

<P>The WSX agent can reply to a WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN with one of these
messages:
<UL>
<LI>WSX_OK - send a HTTP reply to the user (HTTP code 200).  This can be
HTML text, or the name of a file containing binary data.
<LI>WSX_MULTIPART - send a HTTP reply to the user, as for WSX_OK, but
continue waiting for WSX messages from the WSX agent.  This allows a WSX
agent to send multipart messages to the web browser.  The last message, if
any, should be a WSX_OK.
<LI>WSX_BIN - send a HTTP reply to the user, as for WSX_OK, but where the
body contains arbitrary binary data, e.g. an image file.
<LI>WSX_MBIN - As WSX_MULTIPART, for binary data.
<LI>WSX_ERROR - return error status to the user (HTTP codes 3xx, 4xx, or
5xx).  The user will get the error message as formatted by the web server
according to the configuration profile.
<LI>WSX_REDIRECT - redirect the request to another URL.  This is returned to
the browser as a code 302.
<LI>WSX_RESTART - show a page of HTML to the user (HTTP code 200), then
restart the web server.  All open connections (HTTP and FTP) are killed by
this action.
<LI>WSX_KILL - show a page of HTML to the user (HTTP code 200), then
terminate the web server.  All open connections (HTTP and FTP) are killed by
this action.
</UL>

<P>The following macros prepare and send reply messages:
<PRE>send_wsx_ok        (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_multipart (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_bin       (QID *to, qbyte html_size, byte *html_data);
send_wsx_mbin      (QID *to, qbyte html_size, byte *html_data);
send_wsx_error     (QID *to, dbyte error_code);
send_wsx_redirect  (QID *to, char *new_url);
send_wsx_restart   (QID *to, char *html_data);
send_wsx_kill      (QID *to, char *html_data);
</PRE>

<P>Note that the 'to' argument in these calls is the queue id of the smthttp
agent, which sent the original WSX_REQUEST or WSX_REQBIN message.

<P>The code for unpacking these messages (if you're calling a WSX agent) is
similar to that described above for WSX_REQUEST and WSX_REQBIN. You can see
the details in smtmsg.h.

<P>The WSX_OK, WSX_MULTIPART, WSX_RESTART, and WSX_KILL messages send
'html_data' to the web server. This data should respect the rules for CGI
output. Normally it would be a HTML page, e.g.:
<PRE>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hello World!
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

<P>You can also start the data with your own HTTP header fields if necessary,
using the traditional blank line to separate the header from the body, e.g.:
<PRE>Cache-control: no-cache

&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hello World!
&lt;/HTML&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>

<P>This argument must be a string, so to transfer binary data, Xitami also
understands the syntax '@filename', where <I>filename</I> refers to a
<EM>temporary</EM> file that Xitami will parse, send, then delete.  The file
should start with a 'Content-Type: some/type' header, followed by a blank
line, and the file data.  A WSX_BIN or WSX_MBIN message is probably more
efficient for transferring binary data, unless you already have a temporary
file sitting around.

<P>The WSX_BIN and WSX_MBIN messages send a binary block of data back to the
web server. This should be formatted with a Content-Type: header, a blank
line, and the binary data as follows:
<PRE>Content-Type: xxxx/yyyy

..binary data..
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="TOC134">Starting From A Skeleton Program</A></H4>

<P>If you start writing a new WSX program, start from a skeleton. The
xierror program is a simple example of a single-threaded, context-free WSX
agent. This is pretty much the simplest example you can make. You should
start by copying xierror.l and xierror.c to new files (keep these
extensions).

<P>Like any SMT agent, you start the design phase in the dialog (.l file).
Look at the dialog file, either using a text editor, or using the Libero
tool (which is amply documented in the Libero documentation from the iMatix
web site).  You'll need to install Libero to make any changes to the agent.

<H4><A NAME="TOC135">Modifying The Server main() Function</A></H4>

<P>Before you can test a WSX agent you must install it into the server
main() function.  This is how the xierror agent is defined in the Xitami
program (xitami.c).  First, we define a prototype near the start of the
program:
<PRE>int xierror_init (void);         /*  Xitami error simulation agent    */
</PRE>

<P>Then we initialise the xierror agent before starting the main HTTP agent.
Here is the code which initialises all the WSX agents, then the main smthttp
agent:
<PRE>xiadmin_init ();                 /*  Xitami administration agent      */
xierror_init ();                 /*  Xitami error simulation agent    */
smthttp_init (rootdir, cgidir);
</PRE>

<P>The order of these initialisation functions can be important.  For
example, if you want to install dynamic WSX aliases (see below) when your
agent initialises, you must add the xxxx_init() call <I>after</I> the call
to smthttp_init().  This provides smthttp the opportunity to create its
main thread.

<P>The Windows 95 and Windows NT source code is available for individual
developers and companies at various prices - contact us for details. You can
purchase this if you want to make OEM versions of the Windows servers.
The OS/2, UNIX, and OpenVMS source code is supplied with the Xitami source
package.

<H4><A NAME="TOC136">Modifying The Server Config Files</A></H4>

<P>To install a 'static' WSX agent you have to change the config files for
the server; add an entry to the [WSX] section like this:
<PRE>[WSX]
path=agent
</PRE>
Where 'path' is a single word that identifies all URLs passed to this WSX
agent, and 'agent' is the agent name (as defined internally in the agent).
You can define a different path per virtual host, or organise your site so
that specific WSX agents are only available on specific virtual hosts.

<P>It is also possible to add and remove paths at runtime.  There are two
macros that do this:
<PRE>send_wsx_install (QID *to, char *vhost, char *path, char *agent);
send_wsx_cancel  (QID *to, char *vhost, char *path);
</PRE>

<P>Note that the 'to' argument in these calls is the queue id of the smthttp
agent. You should use the following style of code to identify this queue id:
<PRE>THREAD *http_thread;

/*  Find 'main' thread in smthttp agent             */
http_thread = thread_lookup (SMT_HTTP, "main");
ASSERT (http_thread);
send_wsx_install (&http_thread-> queue-> qid, NULL, pattern, AGENT_NAME);
</PRE>

<P>The vhost argument tells the smthttp agent what virtual hosts the WSX
agent should be accessible to. If this argument is NULL, the agent will be
accessible to all virtual hosts. If the argument is a virtual host name or
ip address as defined in the [Virtual-Hosts] section of the config file, the
agent will be invisible to other virtual hosts. Note that you can send
several WSX_INSTALL messages, for different virtual hosts, if required.

<H4><A NAME="TOC137">Testing And Debugging The WSX Agent</A></H4>

<P>The best way to test and debug a WSX agent (as for any SMT program) is to
use the Libero animator.  This is a simple code-generation option (-anim)
which causes the agent to display every step it goes through to handle the
request.  Animation output is sent to the console or to one of the log
files, depending on the way you set-up the server.

<P>Since the effects of a bug in a WSX agent will show-up as browser error
messages, or other funny reactions, you can also set the server:debug option
on.  This causes all headers to be logged - a useful way of seeing what is
actually being sent back to the browser.

<H4><A NAME="TOC138">Writing Efficient WSX Agents</A></H4>

<P>The basic rules of multithreaded SMT programming apply.  Your program
should not block.  For example, it'd be a bad idea to try to access a
relational database and execute some SQL code.  The entire web server would
block while the SQL request was being satisfied.

<P>If you need to do database access, there are other, more efficient ways
to do this.  The best way we know is to work with more than one process; the
web server passes requests (transactions) to a second process that handles
them one by one.  You can scale this model up to very large systems handling
tens of transactions per second.  This is the type of approach that is well-
implemented using a WSX agent.
