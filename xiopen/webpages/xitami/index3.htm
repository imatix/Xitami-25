<H2><A NAME="TOC17">Administration</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="TOC18">Xitami Under Windows</A></H3>

<P>The Windows version of Xitami provides a simple control panel that lets
you start, stop, and monitor the web server. The service version is easily
installed as an NT service, or can be run as a command-line program. It then
accepts the command-line switches described later.

<H3><A NAME="TOC19">Xitami Under UNIX</A></H3>

<P>Under UNIX, Xitami can run as a foreground process or a daemon. You can
run it interactively to test your configuration, and then configure your
system <TT>inittab</TT> or start-up scripts to run it automatically.

<A NAME="syntax">&nbsp;</A>
<P>This is the command-line syntax for Xitami:

<PRE>Syntax: xitami [options...]
Options:
  -r directory     Root directory for web pages (webpages).
  -c directory     Directory for CGI programs (cgi-bin).
  -b portbase      Shift HTTP port 80 by this value.  E.g. to run
                   Xitami on port 7080, do 'xitami -b 7000'.
  -l filename      Log file for output (xitami.log).
  -a filename      Authentication file (xitami.aut).
  -q               Quite mode: no messages or log.
  -s               Server mode: run as background job.
  -t               Trace all socket i/o operations to log file.
  -v               Show Xitami version information.
  -h               Show summary of command-line options.
</PRE>

<P>The -s option has no effect on Windows systems; under UNIX it
does the following: Xitami recreates itself as a background
process, ignoring the SIGHUP signal.

<H3><A NAME="TOC20">Testing Xitami</A></H3>

<P>Run Xitami as described in the installation section. Connect with a
browser to the URL: <TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>/</TT> or
<TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>:5080/</TT>. If Xitami is correctly installed,
you should see a page entitled: "Welcome To Xitami". Please read this page
and try the various links and buttons to ensure that Xitami is working
correctly. If you install your own web pages, you can still access the
Xitami Welcome page by using the URL:
<TT>http://<EM>hostname</EM>/default.htm</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="TOC21">Using Xitami</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Xitami assumes that all web pages are in a subdirectory called
'webpages'.
<LI>CGI scripts and programs are in a subdirectory called
'cgi-bin'.
<LI>Directories can be protected by editing the file 'xitami.aut'.
<LI>Logging information is stored in two files: 'xitami.log' logs
information and error messages; 'access.log' logs HTTP requests.
</UL>
<P>These options can be changed. The webpages directory can be any relative
(depending on the directory where Xitami is run) or absolute directory (with
a full path name).

<P>The cgi-bin directory can be specified in various ways - see the section
on <A href="index5.htm#cgidir">CGI programming</A> in Xitami.

<P>Xitami will negotiate with the web browser to find a file when the URL
does not specify a filename. It will search for an HTML file called
index.htm, index.html, default.htm, or default.html, in that order. If none
of these files are found, Xitami returns the directory listing, formatted as
an HTML page.  Note that Xitami automatically looks for files with an
extension .html if a file with the .htm extension could not be found, and
vice-versa.

<P>You should install a file called 'index.htm' in the webpages directory,
to override the 'default.htm' file used by Xitami.

<H3><A NAME="TOC22">User Authentication</A></H3>

<P>Xitami supports the HTTP/1.0 Basic Authentication protocol. This is a
minimalistic security approach that is quick and supported by all browsers,
but which should not be used for very sensitive data, since the user name
and password can be extracted from the TCP/IP packets sent by the browser.

<P>The xitami.aut file holds the authentication information. This file is
not encoded, but is not accessible by browsers unless you place it in the
webpages directory. You can modify this file on the fly; Xitami will reload
it after a short delay (the server:refresh option).

<P>Protection is applied to directories or individual URLs. This is what
an authentication file looks like:

<PRE>#  Authorization file for XITAMI
#  Each [Entry] defines a protected URL or directory.
#  The directory name is followed by user=password pairs
#
[/Admin]
    admin=top secret
    realm=On-Line Administration
[stats/index.htm]
    root=PakYupTon
    admin=QzeCat96
    webmask=local
[/private]
    jacky="funny;password"
    sarah=arabica
    jonas=realtime
</PRE>

<P>Each section name specifies an URI or a directory name; the leading slash
is optional. When checking a resource called "/pub/mypages/file", Xitami will
look for entries in this order:
<PRE>[/pub/mypages/file]
[pub/mypages/file]
[/pub/mypages]
[pub/mypages]
[/pub]
[pub]
[/]
</PRE>

<P>The directory or URL name is not case-sensitive; Xitami always treats it
as lower-case. On systems where filenames are case-sensitive, "PRIVATE" and
"private" are treated as equal by Xitami, and are both handled by the
authentication data for [Private]. The user name is also case-insensitive.
The password is case-insensitive if the option security:password-case is set
to 0.

<P>Passwords can contain any printable character except ' and ". If you edit
or create the password file by hand or using scripts, use double quotes
around passwords to make sure that special characters like ; and # (which
indicate comments) are treated as part of the password.

<P>The entry 'webmask=' is treated in a special manner; this defines the
set of valid IP addresses for clients trying to access the directory.
The section on <A href="index4.htm#webmasks">webmasks</A> provides more details.  If you define an entry
consisting only of 'webmask=', Xitami will treat this as a resource that is
protected (has an entry) but has no valid users.

<P>The entry 'realm=' is also treated in a special manner; this defines the
'Realm' for the authentication.  The realm is returned to the browser, and
is the basis upon which it will remember user names and passwords.  If you
use the same realm for several directories or URLs, make sure that the user
names and passwords also match.  If no realm is defined, Xitami returns the
[Entry] name as the realm.

<P>The entry 'http-update=' is used to determine whether the HTTP PUT, COPY,
MOVE, and DELETE methods are allowed for the URL. By default these are not
permitted. To allow them, add 'http-update=1' to the authorisation file.

<P>A password "-" is treated as meaning 'not allowed' for that user. If
there is only one user defined, the resource will be inaccessible. This is
used, for example, in the default xitami.aut file to indicate that the
administration URL '/admin' is not accessibly until a non-default password
has been entered.  An empty password is treated as meaning 'non required'
for that user.

<P>The entry 'all=*' allows access to all users without a user id/password
check.  You can combine this with the webmask option to restrict access by
webmask without requiring user id/password entry at the same time.

<P>When using Xitami/Pro's SSL connection, you can allow access to a
protected resource to users who have a valid certificate.  Certified users
will bypass the 'user/password' prompt, and access the protected resource
directly.  For this to work, you must define the password for each such user
as '*SSL'.  This is taken to mean: allow this user access if they have a
valid certificate.

<H3><A NAME="TOC23">Xitami Log Files</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="TOC24">The Xitami Server Log File</A></H4>

<P>Xitami logs errors and information to the file 'xitami.log'. This file is
always opened in append mode. It looks something like this:
<PRE>96/12/05 20:19:41: I: OPEN port=80
96/12/06 07:22:03: I: OPEN port=80
</PRE>
To configure the server log, see the <A href="index4.htm#config_serverlog">[Serverlog]</A>
configuration entry.

<P>By default, Xitami logs all HTTP requests to the file 'access.log', which
follows the common CERN/NCSA standard for web server log files. The log file
format consists of lines in this format:
<PRE>host - user [DD/Mon/YYYY:hh:mm:ss] "request" ddd bbbb "referer" "agent"
</PRE>
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR NOWRAP><TH>This field:<TH>Has this purpose:
<TR NOWRAP><TD>host       <TD>IP number of requesting host
<TR NOWRAP><TD>user       <TD>Userid sent for authentication, or -
<TR NOWRAP><TD>request    <TD>HTTP request sent by client
<TR NOWRAP><TD>ddd        <TD>Status code returned by server
<TR NOWRAP><TD>bbbb       <TD>Size of data sent, excluding HTTP header
<TR NOWRAP><TD>referer    <TD>Referer document, or ""
<TR NOWRAP><TD>agent      <TD>User agent (browser), or ""
</TABLE>

<P>The access log files are automatically cycled: when Xitami starts, it
will save any existing file before starting a new access log. The old access
log file is given a name based on the date when it was last modified.

<H4><A NAME="TOC25">Extended Logging</A></H4>

<P>Xitami has an extended logging function that is much richer than the
standard access logging function. The extended logging function gives you
more control over the way that log files are cycled, over the log file
names, and over the log file format. The extended logging function also does
reverse-DNS translation of IP addresses.

The extended logging function works with access logs and error logs, and is
controlled by a number of additional configuration options in the
[ServerLog], [AccessLog], [ErrorLog], [FTPLog], and [FTPErrLog] sections:


<DL>
<DT><TT><B>format</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the log file format.  You can use one of a number of
predefined formats, or build your own format using any of these symbols:

</TABLE>
<DD>Default: CLFX (compatible with standard Xitami).
<P>Note that the XML-based format are easy to work with using iMatix's GSLgen
tool.  GSLgen lets you create arbitrary reports, statistics, and HTML analyses
of access log data.

<DT><TT><B>cycle</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies when to cycle the log file.  Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>startup, or 0 - cycle log when the server is starts;
<LI>hourly, or 1 - cycle log each hour
<LI>daily, or 2 - cycle log each day
<LI>weekly, or 3 - cycle log each week
<LI>monthly, or 4 - cycle log each month
<LI>manual, or 5 - manual cycling only
<LI>size, or 6 - cycle the log file when it exceeds some size in Kbytes
<LI>lines, or 7 - cycle the log file when it exceeds some size in lines
</UL>
<DD>Default: daily.

<DT><TT><B>cycle-how</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies how to cycle the log file.  Can be one of:
<UL>
<LI>rename - rename the old log file, and create a new file.
<LI>delete - delete the old log file, and create a new file.
<LI>move - move the old log file to some directory, and create a new file.
<LI>concat - append the old log file to some file, and create a new file.
<LI>process - run an arbitrary command to process the file, then create a
new file.
</UL>
<DD>Default: rename.

<DT><TT><B>cycle-time</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies what time to cycle the log file.  This is used for the
'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', and 'monthly' cycle options.  It can specify a
number of minutes (past the hour), or a time in hours and minutes formatted
like this: 'hh:mm'.  For instance, if this is set to '03:30' and the cycle
option is 'daily', then the log file will be cycled at 3.30am each day.
<DD>Default: 00:00 (cycle at midnight).

<DT><TT><B>cycle-day</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the day of the week (for cycle=weekly) or the day of the month
(for cycle=monthly) to cycle the log file.  0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.
<DD>Default: 0.

<DT><TT><B>cycle-size</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the limit, in whole Kbytes, for the cycle=size option.  When
the log file exceeds this size, it will be cycled.
<DD>Default: 0.

<DT><TT><B>cycle-lines</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies the limit, in lines, for the cycle=lines option.  When the log
file exceeds this size, it will be cycled.
<DD>Default:

<DT><TT><B>cycle-arg</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies an argument used for the various cycle-how options:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Cycle-how:  <TH>Uses argument like this:
<TR><TD>Rename      <TD>As time-stamped filename.
<TR><TD>Delete      <TD>Does not use argument.
<TR><TD>Move        <TD>As target directory name.
<TR><TD>Concat      <TD>As time-stamped filename.
<TR><TD>Process     <TD>As time-stamped command to execute.
</TABLE>
The time-stamping function expands symbols in the argument as follows:
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TH>Symbol:     <TH>Expands to give this:
<TR><TD>%y          <TD>day of year, 001-366
<TR><TD>%yy         <TD>year 2 digits, 00-99

<TR><TD>%ww         <TD>week of year, 01-53
<TR><TD>%q          <TD>year quarter, 1-4
<TR><TD>%h          <TD>hour, 00-23
<TR><TD>%m          <TD>minute, 00-59
<TR><TD>%s          <TD>second, 00-59
<TR><TD>%c          <TD>centisecond, 00-99
<TR><TD>%%          <TD>literal character %
</TABLE>
Additionally, when used for cycle-how=process, the argument can also contain
'%f', which is expanded to give the name of the old log file.
<DD>Default: ac%yy%mm%dd.log for the access log and er%yy%mm%dd.log for the
error log.

<DT><TT><B>translate</B></TT>
<DD>Specifies whether the log file IP addresses are translated or not.
This can slow-down the server, especially if reverse-DNS lookups are not
working correctly, so always test this carefully before using it.  Note that
if translation is enabled, that you must configure the RDNS setup as
described in the section on <A href="index4.htm#config_rdns">RDNS configuration</A>.
<DD>Default: 0 (not enabled).
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="TOC26">Building Multilanguage Web Sites</A></H3>

<P>Xitami accepts the HTTP Accept-Language field and tries to do something
useful with it.  Not all browsers let you set this field, but some do.
This field lets users specify their preferences for particular versions of
documents.  For instance, if a user specifies that they prefer documents in
French, then English, the Accept-Language field will contain "fr, en".
Xitami handles this as follows, for a document URL "file.htm":
<UL>
<LI>If the file "file.htm" exists and is readable, Xitami returns it to the
browser as usual.
<LI>If the file does not exist, Xitami will search for "file.html",
"file.htm.fr", "file.htm_fr", "file.html.fr", "file.html_fr", "file.htm.en",
"file.htm_en", "file.html.en", and "file.html_en" in that order.
<LI>If the file is still not found, Xitami returns a 404 error status.
</UL>
<P>The same applies to default pages and to CGI scripts, and filters.  Note
that Xitami will only do the extra checking for alternative htm/html files
for .htm and .html files.
