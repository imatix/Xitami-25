<H2><A NAME="TOC62">Using The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</A></H2>

<P>Xitami supports CGI programs in Perl, C, or any other language
that your system supports.  In general, CGI program written for
web servers such as Apache and NCSA httpd will run unchanged with
Xitami.

<P>A 'CGI' program is considered to be any URL with '/cgi-bin'
somewhere in the path name.  These are all examples of valid
CGI program URLs:
<PRE>http://localhost/cgi-bin/myprog
http://localhost/cgi-bin/myprog.pl
http://localhost/products/install/cgi-bin/myprog</PRE>

<P>Xitami defines these CGI environment variables:
<UL>
<LI>For each HTTP header field, inserts a symbol called HTTP_xxxx
where xxxx is the header field name.  The field names are put
into uppercase, and hyphens replaced by underlines.
<LI>For each variable in the query string, inserts a symbol
called FORM_xxxx where xxxx is the variable name.
<LI>SERVER_SOFTWARE is the name of the web server.
<LI>SERVER_VERSION is the version of the web server (2.5b6).
<LI>SERVER_NAME is the current host name.  This can be overridden by
defining a value for server:hostname.
<LI>SERVER_URL holds the full URL to the server.
<LI>SERVER_PORT is the port on which the current request was sent.
<LI>SERVER_HTTP_PORT is the current HTTP port (usually 80).
<LI>SERVER_HTTPS_PORT is the current HTTPS port (usually 443).
<LI>SERVER_PROTOCOL is the HTTP version in use (e.g. "HTTP/1.0").
<LI>SERVER_SECURITY is "SSL" for SSL connections, else "-".
<LI>SERVER_SSL_PORT is the port on which the web server is running
in SSL (HTTPS) mode, if SERVER_SECURITY is "SSL".
<LI>GATEWAY_INTERFACE is the CGI version in use (e.g. "CGI/1.1").
<LI>REQUEST_METHOD is the HTTP method used, "GET" or "POST".
<LI>QUERY_METHOD is same as the REQUEST_METHOD.
<LI>CONTENT_TYPE is the Content-Type: HTTP field.
<LI>CONTENT_LENGTH is the Content-Length: HTTP field.
<LI>REMOTE_USER is the authorised username, if any, else "-"; this
will only be set if the user has accessed a protected URL.
<LI>REMOTE_HOST is the same as REMOTE_ADDR.  Xitami does not
translate host addresses into names.
<LI>REMOTE_ADDR is the address of the remote host, "x.x.x.x".
<LI>SCRIPT_PATH is the path of the script being executed.
<LI>SCRIPT_NAME is the URI of the script being executed.
<LI>QUERY_STRING is the query string following the URL.
<LI>PATH_INFO is any path data following the CGI URL.
<LI>PATH_TRANSLATED is the full translated path with URL arguments.
<LI>CGI_ROOT is the CGI binary directory.
<LI>CGI_STDIN is the CGI standard input filename.
<LI>CGI_STDOUT is the CGI standard output filename.
<LI>CGI_STDERR is the CGI standard error filename, if any.
<LI>DOCUMENT_ROOT is the main webpages root directory.
</UL>
<P>A CGI program can get arguments from a number of places, depending on how
Xitami is configured and how the HTTP request is made.
<UL>
<LI>For GET requests, it is usual to follow the URL with '?' and some
arguments. These are passed to the CGI program in the QUERY_STRING variable.
The standard format for passing a number of variables in this way is (e.g.):
<PRE>http://hostname/cgi-bin/someprog?var1=value1&var2=value2...
</PRE>
<LI>If the arguments do not contain '=', they are broken into separate
arguments and passed to the CGI program that way too.  Each '+' in the query
string is used as a separator.  This may be used in a URL like this:
<PRE>http://hostname/cgi-bin/someprog?arg1+arg2+arg3...
</PRE>
<LI>Larger amounts of data should be passed using the POST method, in which
case the CGI program reads the data from its stdin stream.  (You can also
configure Xitami to pass these in the QUERY_STRING variable if the data is
not too large).
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="TOC63">CGI Programs Under 16-bit Windows</A></H3>

<P>The 16-bit Windows version of Xitami does not support CGI.

<H3><A NAME="TOC64">CGI Programs Under 32-bit Windows</A></H3>

<P>Under Windows 95 and NT, you can run different types of CGI programs:

<UL>
<LI>16-bit executable .exe files. You do not need to specify the .exe file
extension; Windows will correctly locate an .exe file. A bug in Windows 95
(we think) prevents 16-bit CGI programs from working when the Xitami server
is installed in a directory containing a long filename.

<LI>32-bit executable .exe files. The files do not actually need an .exe.
extension; Xitami will execute a file with any name so long as it is in the
CGI directory and 'looks' like an executable file (precisely: it must start
with the letters "MZ").

<LI>Perl programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "#!" followed by a space and the perl filename. The '.exe'
extension is optional. Perl must be installed on your system. For example,
if your Perl interpreter is located in c:\tools\perl you could start your
Perl program like this:
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl</PRE>
You can use '\' or '/' in the path name.  The Perl script should be
fully specified; Xitami does not assume any kind of extension.  Perl
programs sometimes end in '.pl'; we recommend you use no extension.
To provide compatibility with Perl scripts coming from UNIX, Xitami
will handle a path like '/usr/bin/perl' by removing '/usr/bin/' and
looking for PERL.EXE on the PATH, if /usr/bin/perl does not actually
exist as a file.
You can increase the speed of Perl CGI programs under Windows 95
by adding this definition to your system.ini file (this may also work
under NT; we've not tested it):
<PRE>[NonWindowsApp]
    CommandEnvSize=4096
</PRE>
This reserves memory for DOS applications, and you should make this
setting higher if you have plenty of RAM.

<LI>Awk scripts, and scripts in other UNIX-type languages that accept
comments starting with '#'. Start the script with '#! <interpreter name>' as
for Perl.

<LI>Visual Basic programs. Use the CGI_STDIN and CGI_STDOUT environment
variables to read the HTTP form data, and write the HTML output. You may
want to set cgi:form-fields to 0, since you can pick-up the HTTP form data
from the stdin file instead of the environment. Set cgi:form-query to 1 so
that you have access to the URL arguments if any. Set cgi:stdio to 0 so that
your CGI program has full access to the input and output files.

<LI>Rexx programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "/*!" followed by a space and the full filename for Rexx. The
'.exe' extension is optional. You can close the comment on the same line,
but the '*/' must be the last text on the line.

<LI>Batch files, although their usefulness is limited, since MS-DOS has
trouble with the HTML characters '&lt;' and '&gt;'. </UL>

<P>.com files should run correctly under 32-bit Windows. We recommend that
you use 32-bit executable programs, also called 'console programs'. The
Windows 32-bit interface is more robust and controlled than the 16-bit
interface. One example: if a CGI program loops, Xitami will kill it after a
timeout. But: a 16-bit DOS program will not respond to a kill request, and
will eventually bring the system down.

<H3><A NAME="TOC65">CGI Programs Under UNIX</A></H3>

<P>Under UNIX you can run any file that UNIX recognizes as an executable
file. This includes linked files, Perl scripts, shell scripts, etc.

<H3><A NAME="TOC66">CGI Programs Under OS/2</A></H3>

<P>Under OS/2, you can run different types of CGI programs:

<UL>
<LI>32-bit (and 16-bit) command-line based executable ".exe" files. You do
not need to specify the ".exe" file extension in the URL; Xitami for OS/2
will correctly locate an ".exe" CGI program. Starting PM-based executable
files through CGI is not supported.

<LI>REXX (and CMD) scripts. These files must have a ".cmd" extension, but
this does not have to be specified in the URL unless there is an executable
(".exe") of the same name in the directory (see the details of the search
order below). By default the script will be run by running the program
specified in the COMSPEC environment variable, followed by "/c scriptname",
so if your COMSPEC variable is set to "d:\os2\cmd.exe" then it will be run
as:

<PRE>d:\os2\cmd.exe /c scriptname</PRE>

<P>Optionally you can specify a different interpreter for the script by
using either:
<UL>
  <LI>The OS/2 EXTPROC syntax:
      <PRE>EXTPROC full-path-to-interpreter flags</PRE>
      in the first line of the script file (Xitami will accept flags at
      the end of the EXTPROC line by some other programs may not; test
      carefully); or
  <LI>A special REXX comment:
      <PRE>/*! full-path-to-interpreter flags */</PRE>
      in the first line of the script file.  You can use the standard OS/2
      command interpreter (CMD.EXE) as the interpreter for REXX, but if you
      do then you must specify "/c" as one of the flags to ensure
      the command interpreter exits as soon as the CGI script finishes
      running.
</UL>

<P>Remember the REXX scripts are identified by the "/*" comment in their
first line. The full-path-to-interpreter should specify the full filename
(drive (if it is not on the same drive as everything else), path, and
filename) of the interpreter to use.

<LI>Perl programs. The first line of the program must start with the
characters "#!" followed by a space and the full filename for Perl. For
example if your perl interpreter is "c:\tools\perl.exe" you should start
your Perl program like this:
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl.exe</PRE>
or
<PRE>#! c:\tools\perl</PRE>
You can use '\' or '/' in the path name. The programs are best stored in a
file without an extension, or in a file with a ".cmd" extension; if you use
another extension you will need to specify the whole filename (including the
extension) in the URL. Perl must be installed on your system. Perl 5.004 is
recommended. If your perl script uses special features make sure you are
running the correct perl executable (check the Perl 5.004 for OS/2
documentation) for the features you require.

<LI>Awk scripts, and scripts in other UNIX-type languages that accept
comments starting with '#'. Begin the script with '#! <interpreter name>' as
for Perl.
</UL>

<P>When searching for a CGI program to run, if the program specified has no
extension Xitami for OS/2 first tries adding a ".exe" extension, then if
that fails it tries adding a ".cmd;" extension. If both of those fail, or
the program name already has an extension, the name is tried as is; it will
be considered executable if it has a ".exe" extension, a ".cmd" extension or
the file starts with a "#!" comment line. (REXX scripts and CMD scripts must
be stored in files with a ".cmd" extension because that is all the command
interpter (CMD.EXE) will accept.)

<P>It is not possible to run DOS executables (".exe" or ".com") or DOS batch
files (".bat") under Xitami for OS/2. Nor is it possible to run PM-based
programs as CGI programs.

<A NAME="cgidir">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A NAME="TOC67">CGI Directories</A></H3>

<P>You can specify an alternate CGI directory. By default, Xitami will
search a subdirectory called 'cgi-bin'. This is how Xitami translates a URL
into an absolute file path, when looking for the CGI program:

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TH>'cgi-bin' option:
    <TH>URL:
    <TH>Final pathname:
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>./cgi-bin/products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD><EM>Default</EM>
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>/web/cgibin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>/web/cgibin/products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>/web/cgibin
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/cgi-bin/products/myprog
    <TD>./products/myprog
<TR NOWRAP>
    <TD>.
    <TD>/products/cgi-bin/myprog
    <TD>./webpages/products/cgi-bin/myprog
</TABLE>

<P>This translation works as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If the URL starts with '/cgi-bin' this text is removed, and
the remainder of the path is attached to the 'cgi-bin' option to
give a full path name.
<LI>If the URL does not start with '/cgi-bin', the complete URL
path is attached to the 'webpages' directory to give a file path.
</UL>
<P>Only one of these translations can be done.  By consequence,
any value you specify for the 'cgi-bin' option is ignored if you
place the '/cgi-bin' directory at some deeper level in the URL.
This is useful if you intend to mix CGI programs with your HTML
files, as complete directories.

<H3><A NAME="TOC68">CGI Error Messages</A></H3>

<P>Xitami tries to explain why a CGI program fails; these are the different
messages you may see for a 500 error, with an explanation for each.

<H4><A NAME="TOC69">Insufficient resources to run this CGI program</A></H4>
<P>There is not enough memory available.  This is a bad sign; it means
that the virtual memory available to Xitami is all full.  Stop the
web server, modify your systems' virtual memory settings, and start it
up again.  This problem is very rare, really, especially since Xitami
is a tiny piece of software.

<H4><A NAME="TOC70">CGI arguments are too long - request was refused</A></H4>
<P>The CGI URL argument (text following a '?' after the URL) was too
long.  Whatever you are trying to do, stop it.  (Actually, since release
1.2a, Xitami allocates such buffers dynamically, so this error will not
occur, and it is now rather difficult to hack Xitami by using buffer
overruns.)

<H4><A NAME="TOC71">Cannot create stdin stream for CGI</A></H4>
<P>Xitami communicates with CGI processes using simple text files; if
the file it wants to use already exists and is unavailable to Xitami, it
will not be able to run the CGI process.  Cure: make sure that you only
run one instance of Xitami from one directory.  Delete any files called
'tmp...'.  Make sure no CGI process is still hanging around, looping but
unkillable (typically under Windows 95 or NT with 16-bit CGIs).

<H4><A NAME="TOC72">Cannot create CGI process - program not found</A></H4>
<P>The CGI program exists (otherwise you get a 402 Not Found), but could
not be started correctly.  The most common cause of this error is a Perl
script which has a misformed magic header line.  Make sure that the Perl
script starts with "#! perlpath" where <EM>perlpath</EM> is the full
path name of the Perl executable, e.g. "C:\Perl\Perl.exe".

<H4><A NAME="TOC73">CGI process ended with an error status</A></H4>
<P>The CGI program ran, but returned an error code.  Most servers ignore
this, but Xitami treats this as an error.  Cure: make sure your CGI
programs end correctly with a 'return (0)' or equivalent.  If you cannot
do this, set the configuration option cgi:exit-ok to 0.

<H4><A NAME="TOC74">CGI process was interrupted before ending</A></H4>
<P>Someone or something interrupted the CGI process before it ended.
This can happen when a CGI process takes too long to run, and the system
administrator decides that enough is enough, and kills it.  Cure: ask
your sysadmin to be nice, or write faster CGIs.

<H4><A NAME="TOC75">Internal server error while running CGI</A></H4>
<P>Something unexpected happened inside Xitami's guts when it tried to
run your CGI.  Aaaagh!  What did you do?!  If this happens, let us know
how to reproduce it.

<H4><A NAME="TOC76">Undetermined error</A></H4>
<P>Something else happened.  Cure: tell us about it.
